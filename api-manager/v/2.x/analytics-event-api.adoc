= Analytics Event API 
:keywords: analytics, api, reports

API Manager gathers analytics data for each API you manage.  You can create charts that query and display event data. Using the Analytics Event API you can create reports that query raw event data and expose it through an API endpoint. Reports and charts you create present data by environment.

You can create reports that span multiple APIs, or create different reports for the same API. The Analytics Event API provides a one month retention policy for events and, with a data availability delay of up to 10 minutes.

The Analytics Event API enforces a usage limit of 10 requests/minute, with a maximum of 20,000 events per request. Request rates higher than 10 request/minutes will be throttled.

== To Create a Report

The following procedure describes how to create a report to find the API events that, for example, resulted in a policy violation. Suppose you want to find any events that were rejected because of policy violations, such as rate limiting or IP blacklisting. In step 5, you select Violated Policy Name in Fields to filter the data in this manner. 

. In API Manager > Analytics > Manage Reports, click New to create a new report.
. In Create Report, select a data source, range, and format. 
. In Fields, select Violated Policy Name.
+
A URL appears that you can use to see the report after you save it. The date that data becomes
available for the data source you specified appears.
+
. Save the report.
+
When the report becomes available, go to the URL to view it.

== Running a Report in the Browser

The following steps show you how to run a report. API Analytics lists the starting point for when data is available for the API, including a warning message if no data is available for the API.

On the *Manage Reports* page, click *Run* for the specified report.

After the report runs, the CSV or JSON file contains all of the raw analytics data for the parameters you specified in the report.

=== Use curl to View Report Information

You get the value of $TOKEN by running the curl command in this procedure. The command gets the access_token JSON property of this response.

The authorization header has the form: Authorization: `Bearer {$TOKEN.access_token}`

The use of the jq command-line JSON processor is one possible solution for obtaining the access token value. Download and install this application or one with the same functionality for this procedure.

To view report information programatically:

. Open a new terminal window and execute the following command:
+
[source,xml]
----
TOKEN=$(curl -s https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login -d "username=<YOUR-USERNAME>&password=<YOUR-PASSWORD>" | jq -r .access_token)
----
+
. This command sends a request to the authentication servers of the Anypoint Platform and, if the request is successful, returns an access token that's stored in the `$TOKEN` variable. The value of this variable is displayed below:
+
[source, json,linenums]
----
{
 "access_token": "54545454-5454-5454-5454-545454545454",
 "token_type": "Bearer",
 "redirectUrl": "/accounts/#/cs/profile/home"
 }
----
+
. After the access token has been received, it must be appended to the `Authorization` header in the request to the Analytics Reporting API endpoint for your report. To make a request to this endpoint, copy it from the *Manage Reports* page in the Analytics dashboard. Using the `$TOKEN` variable from the previous step, include it in the next request as shown below:
+
[source,xml]
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics/1.0/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/events?format=csv&startDate=2016-01-01&endDate=2016-12-31&fields=Application%20Name.Client%20IP.Resource%20Path > output.csv"
----
+
. If the request is successful, the response includes a CSV file (as requested) that downloads as a file with the specified name (`output.csv)` in the directory where the `curl` request was made.

An example shell script combining the two curl commands and which displays values in the command prompt window is:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
TOKEN=$(curl -s https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login -d "username=myusername&password=mypassword" | jq -r .access_token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics/1.0/42424242-4242-4242-4242-424242424242/events?format=csv&startDate=2016-01-01&endDate=2016-11-10&fields=Application%20Name.Client%20IP.Resource%20Path"
echo;echo
----

Example output for this command is:

[source,code,linenums]
----
"Application Name","Client IP","Resource Path",Timestamp,"API ID","API Version ID","API Name","API Version Name"
"Las Vegas T-Shirt serviceLas Vegas T-Shirt serviceLas Vegas",83.178.96.0,/,2016-10-03T04:27:02.072Z,61460,63811,"test api contracts",1

=== Support for Environments

For organizations that have enabled environments, API events queried using the approach described above will belong exclusively to the Unclassified" environment. To request events for APIs in a specific environment, select the environment in the environment selector and create the report that you want to run. Reports are stored per-environment, so different reports will exist in different environments. Copy the report URL from the UI, and note that in addition to the Organization ID, the URL also includes `/environment/{Environment ID}`. Anypoint Platform assigns the unique and immutable Organization ID and Environment IDs at organization and environment creation times.
 
The addition of the Environment ID to the report URL is all you need to access events in the specified environment. API IDs are different in different environments: An API's ID in QA will be different from its ID in Production, for example.

|Client IP |IP address of the client making the API request.
|Continent |The continent from which the API request originated (inferred by the IP address of the client).

|Request Size |The size (in bytes) of the incoming client request.
|Resource Path |The path of the client request.
|Response Size |The size in bytes of the API response. See note below.
|Response Time |The processing time of the API request.
|Status Code |The HTTP status code of the response.
|Timezone |The time zone from which the API request originated (inferred by the IP address of the client).
|User Agent Name |The complete user agent string for the incoming client request.
|User Agent Version |The version of the user agent string for the incoming client request.

|===

If the Content-Length header is present, the Response Size is set to that value. If the Content-Length header is not present and the payload is a String, Analytics calculates the length of the String and reports that value. If the Content-Length header is not present and the payload is not a String, Analytics reports the response size as -1. For example, if the output returned is a DataWeave stream and the Content-Length header is not present, Analytics doesn't report a response size because the value is not a String. However if your application performs a String conversion, the response size is listed.
