= To Access the Client ID and Client Secret of a Client App 

As Organization Administrator of the master organization, after you approve a client app to access your API, you can access information about the app from API Manager > Contracts. You can view and reset the unique client ID and client secret for the application. When calling the API, the client app owner needs to pass these credentials if the API is protected with policies.
