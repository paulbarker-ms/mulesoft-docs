= To Enable Gatekeeper

By default, Gatekeeper is enabled to enhance security. If you disabled Gatekeeper, you can enable it as described in this procedure. Add and set the `anypoint.platform.gatekeeper` property to `flexible` or `strict` in the Mule `wrapper.conf` file to enable Gatekeeper. For example:

----
 #On-Prem Configuration: 
 ...
 wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.gatekeeper=flexible
