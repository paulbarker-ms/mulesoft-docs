= Testing Add and Remove Request Header Policies

To test the execution of policies, follow the steps in this section to apply a policy and use curl, for example `curl` `+http://localhost:8081 -vvv+` to test the policies.

== Add Request Header Policy

The procedure for testing the add or remove request header policies assume that you created a mule application that logs the headers received by the backend service.

. Apply the add request header policy to add a header as described in the previous section.
. Run curl.
. Check the log of the backend service to verify that request includes the additional header name and value you configured in step 1.


=== Remove Request Header Policy

The procedure for testing the remove request header policy assumes that you created a mule application that logs the headers received by the backend service.

. Apply the remove request header policy to remove a header as described in the previous section.
. Run curl.
. Verify that the backend service excludes the extra header by checking the log.

. Run curl again.
. Verify that the specified header is received.
