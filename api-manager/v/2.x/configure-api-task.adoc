= To Configure an API Endpoint

You can set up one of the following types of endpoint management:

* Direct management of the endpoint: Basic endpoint
+
Set up a basic endpoint.
+
* Management by proxy: Endpoint with proxy
+
Set up a basic endpoint if you create your API outside API Manager. For example, if you create the API using Mule Runtime, you don't need a proxy.

You can save and later modify configuration of an API versions or instance.

. In API Manager, click the version, or an instance, of an API.
+
If you previously created an instance of the version, click the instance you want to reconfigure. 
+
API Configuration appears.

+
. Above API Configuration, in Add Consumer Endpoint, optionally enter the public-facing URL for the API. For example, enter `+http://product.mydomain.com+`.
+
. In Managing Type, choose Basic Endpoint or Endpoint with Proxy.
+
* In Implementation URI, optionally enter the URL of the site that hosts the API or accept the default, a dummy URI.
+
Typically, you accept the default. The URI is not required, and often unknown, at this point. 
* If you choose Endpoint With Proxy, select a proxy deployment target Cloudhub or Hybrid.
+
Hybrid is a product for managing servers. You need to register a server with Mule Agent 1.9.0 to deploy the API to a Mule 3.8 or later hybrid target.
+
If you choose Endpoint With Proxy, also accept the default Path `/` for the proxy endpoint, or enter another path. For example, changing the path to `/users` makes the REST call to the service at the implementation URI `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users+`. 
. Click Save, or optionally set advanced options, and then save.
. In Advanced Options, optionally assign an instance label for the proxy, or accept the label, and set a response timeout.
. Click ADD A TAG to enter a tag name, such as Released, to signal the status of an API Version to users. 

Now, you are ready to configure deployment.
