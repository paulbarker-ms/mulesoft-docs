= What's New in Policy Management

In Mule 4, classloader isolation exists between the application, the runtime and the connectors, and policies. 

Other changes to policies are:

* All policies are non-blocking, which is described in Mule 4 documentation. 
* All policies except CORS, which is executed first, can be ordered. 
* Resource level policy support, which was restricted to RAML-based APIs, is extended to any HTTP API. 
* You can distribute policies outside of the runtime, which simplifies upgrades.

Mule 4 introduces changes to the packaging, size and scope of a policy.

== Changes to MuleSoft-Provided Policies

Notable changes to policies for governing APIs are:

* API Manager now provides two HTTP Basic Authentication policies, one based on the simplest technique for enforcing access control to web resources and the other on the LDAP configuration.
+
If you upgrade APIs from the Jul 2017 to Nov 2017, the security manager setup information is no longer required. The policy incorporates the information.
* Header propagation no longer occurs by default. You can configure header propagation for token enforcement and rate limiting policies by checking the Expose Headers checkbox.
* You can configure the rate limiting policy to share the quota among the cluster nodes (default) or not.
