= Workflow: Deploying a Mule 4 Proxy

In this workflow, you put an asset in place in Exchange, or design an API in Exchange and publish it to Exchange. You manage the API from API Manager. Next, you deploy the Mule 4 proxy. Finally, you modify the proxy. 

. Create an API asset in, or design and publish one to, Exchange:

* WSDL, HTTP, or HTTPS API: In Exchange, link:/anypoint-exchange/to-create-an-asset[create an asset], selecting the asset type that corresponds to the type of proxy.
* RAML API: In Design Center, link:/design-center/v/1.0/design-raml-api-task[design an API Specification] and link:/design-center/v/1.0/publish-project-exchange-task[publish the API design project to Exchange]. Alternatively, link:/design-center/v/1.0/upload-raml-task[upload an existing RAML to Exchange].
