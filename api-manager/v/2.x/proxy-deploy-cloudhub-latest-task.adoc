= To Deploy a Proxy to CloudHub

In API Manager, follow this procedure to deploy a proxy to CloudHub if you use Mule 3.8 Runtime, API Gateway 2.1 or later, or Mule 4.x. 

// From API Manager, deployment using Mule 4 Early Access is not supported.

During the configuration of an API instance, you specify to manage the instance as a basic endpoint or as endpoint with a proxy. If you specify deployment to CloudHub of an endpoint with a proxy, use this deployment procedure.

// What permissions do you need?

. In API Manager, click Manage API > Manage API From Exchange, and configure management of the proxy asset.
. In API Configurations, if you want to deploy the API to Mule 4, check this box: Check This Box If You Are Managing This Api In Mule 4. The checkbox is located at the bottom of API Configurations as shown in the following RAML, SOAP, and HTTP configuration screenshots:

. Check Update Application If Exists if you want to redeploy the proxy to Cloudhub. Uncheck this option if you do not want to continue with deployment if the proxy is already deployed. In the latter case, deployment fails.
