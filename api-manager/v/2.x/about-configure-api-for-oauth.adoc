= About OAuth Policy Prerequisites
:keywords: oauth, raml, token, validation, policy

Prerequisites for using an OAuth 2.0 policy are:

* Applying the policy to the API
* Having an OAuth 2.0 provider
* A securityScheme if the API is RAML-based

Within the RAML securitySchemes definition, you include URIs for the authorization and access token for a Mule OAuth 2.0 provider as shown in the following example:

----
settings:
   authorizationUri: https://oauth2provider.cloudhub.io/authorize
   accessTokenUri:  https://oauth2provider.cloudhub.io/access_token
   authorizationGrants: [authorization_code, password, client_credentials, implicit]
----

Also, add the securedBy node after the method name of the resource and method you want to secure, as shown in the following example: 

----
/users:
  get:
    securedBy: [oauth_2_0]
----

The following table maps the RAML grant types to the grant type names in the OAuth 2.0 policy configuration.Â

|===
|Authorization Grant Types Defined in RAML Definition |Equivalent Authorization Grant Type to Enable in the OAuth Provider Policy |Supported in embedded APIkit Console?
|`[implicit]` |Implicit |Yes
|`[client_credentials]` |Client Credentials |No
|`[password]` |Resource Owner Password Credentials |No
|`[authorization_code]` |Authorization Code |Yes

After meeting these prerequisites, you are ready to build the provider.
