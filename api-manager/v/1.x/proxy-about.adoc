= About Deploying Proxies 
:keywords: proxy, api, rest, raml, soap, cloudhub

API Gateway, incorporated in Mule Runtime 3.8 and later, is the server that hosts a Mule proxy application. To deploy an API from API Manager, you typically create a proxy application that serves to stop attacks aimed at the actual server. This proxy application is sometimes called an auto-generated proxy.

// You can use API Designer, AnyPoint Studio, or Mule runtime to design, run, and debug code prior to deployment of the proxy in API Manager. 

After deploying an API, you can govern the API using policies. You can set API alerts to send a notification about conditions, such as an API returning a certain HTTP error code.

== Deployment Prerequisites

You need to meet the following prerequisites, depending on the type of deployment:

*General Prerequisites*

* Presence of an API version in API Manager
* API Versions Owner permissions for the API, or membership in the Organization Administrators role 
* The URL of the server where the API is running

*Deployment to your server*

Access to a Mule 3.8.0 Runtime, or later, instance or an API Gateway instance that has been configured to pair with your organization. Configure the API Gateway if using versions of Mule earlier than 3.8.0.

*Automatic deployment to your server*

Valid permissions for the Runtime Manager and the API Manager of your organization. Also, the private server must be registered.

*Automatic CloudHub deployment*

Permissions for the Runtime Manager and API Manager of your organization.

*Manual CloudHub deployment*

An Anypoint Platform account and an Anypoint Platform client ID and client secret to pair the deployment with an organization.

You need valid permissions for the Runtime Manager and API Manager of your organization to deploy a proxy.

=== HTTPS with the API

. In the Configure Endpoint menu, provide an implementation URI to an HTTPS address. Specifying an HTTPS address modifies the proxy to support HTTPS. By default, the proxy signs requests using the default HTTPS credentials of the JVM.
. If you want to include other HTTPS credentials, download the proxy and modify it accordingly.
+
If you plan to import your proxy application into Studio 6.x or later, you can choose in API Manager whether to link the application to a domain or not. 
+
. Modify the http:request-config element in the `proxy.xml` file of the proxy to include TLS configuration elements that point to the required truststore/keystore.
