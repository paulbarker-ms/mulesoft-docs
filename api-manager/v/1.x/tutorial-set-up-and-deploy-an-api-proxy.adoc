= To Set Up and Deploy an API Proxy
:keywords: api, notebook, client

In this procedure, you create a proxy for an API and deploy the proxy to CloudHub if you have an account. The status indicator shows the progress of the deployment, and upon deployment, an indicator appears saying that the endpoint is registered. If you do not want to deploy the proxy to CloudHub, download the proxy for deployment to another server.

. In Anypoint Platform, click API Manager, and in API Administration, click an API version of an API.

The API version details page for the API appears:
