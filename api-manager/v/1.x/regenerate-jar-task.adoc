= Regenerate the JAR

This file is obsolete.

////

After configuring the WSDL, RAML, HTTP, or HTTPS proxy properties in config.properties, you need to regenerate the JAR to include the modified config.properties. 

. Regenerate the JAR using the following command:
+
`zip -r configuredProxy.jar proxyFolder`
+
Include all files _within_ the folder, but do _not_ include the root proxyFolder; otherwise, Mule Runtime rejects the app.
. If you are modifying a RAML or HTTPS proxy, perform the following step for that proxy type:
+
* RAML: Check the exportedResources list in the mule-artifact.json file to make sure the proxy exports all the dependent files of the API specification. If there are any missing files, add them to the mule-artifact.json, and regenerate the JAR.
+
image::mule-artifact.png[]
+
* HTTPS: Export your keystore file so it can be used by the proxy listener. This can be done by going to the mule-artifact.json file and completing the exportedResources list:
+
image::mule-artifact-https.png[]

Now, you can deploy the proxy and API Manager tracks it.
