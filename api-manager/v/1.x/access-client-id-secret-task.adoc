= To Access an Application Client ID and Client Secret

As Organization Administrator, after you approve a client app to access your API, you can access information about the app from API Manager > Client Applications. You can view and reset the unique client ID and client secret for the application. When calling the API, the client app owner needs to pass these credentials if the API is protected with policies.
