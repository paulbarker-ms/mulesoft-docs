. Open a new text file, and create policy, before, and pointcut elements.
. Create policy, ID, and policyName elements to track the policy for analytics.

<policy xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/policy"
        id="{{policyId}}"
        policyName="Regex Filter"
----
+
. Add a `before` section to execute on every request to the API before the actual API services are called. The `after` section is not needed; return results need no processing. 
. Include a filter element in the before section that references an element named Expression. This filter element has a name property that matches the referenced element.
+
The expression parameter specifies the filtering conditions and the targeted element to filter. The YAML file defines these parameters, which are wrapped in `{{curly brackets}}` in the XML configuration file: {{regexFilter}} is used as the filtering condition. `{{queryParamm}}` is used to construct expression that references the desired query parameter.
+
. Include a message filter, which is a standard Mule element, to filter the incoming request. This element does not actually define the filter logic, but references the Expression element that specifies the filterâ€™s behavior.
. Add an onUnaccepted property in the opening tag of the filter element in the before section references the policyViolation element.

<before> 
  <mule:message-filter xmlns:mule="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core" onUnaccepted="policyViolation"> 
    <mule:filter ref="Expression"/> 
  </mule:message-filter> 
</before>
----
+
When the criteria specified by the filter is not matched, this property calls and executes the referenced element.
+
. Save the file using a .xml extension.
