= To Set Up an API
:keywords: api, define, creator, create, setup

You can set up an API by importing one into API Manager, by using auto-discovery, or by defining the API in API Manager. This procedure covers the latter. Setting up an API consists of naming the API and a version. Other entries are optional. API Manager creates an API version details page, which has controls such as API Definition, for managing the API. 

. In Anypoint Platform, click API Manager.
+
. On the API Administration page, click Add new API.
. Enter a name, version, and brief description of your API. For example:
+
* API Name: placeholder
* Version Name: 1.0.development
* Description: This API consumes the JSONPlaceholder REST Service.
+
. Skip entering a URL for API Endpoint. This URL is not required at this point.
+
. Click Add.
