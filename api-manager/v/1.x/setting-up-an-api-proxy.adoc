:keywords: proxy, api, rest, raml, soap, cloudhub

A proxy abstracts the API to a layer that can be managed by API Manager. A proxy for a REST API should meet the following criteria:

* Accepts incoming service calls from applications and routes them to the URI of the target API.
* Copies any message headers from the service call and passes them along to the API.
* Avoids passing internal Mule headers both to the API and back to the requester. 
* Captures message headers from the API response and attaches them to the response message.
* Routes the response to the application that made the service call.

Here's what a REST proxy might look like in Studio.

The anatomy of a SOAP proxy is similar. From this structure, you can add additional functionality – to log data, for example.
