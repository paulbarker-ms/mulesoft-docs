= To Test an Alert

This procedure describes how to test a request count alert. This procedure requires the following preparation:

. Design an API.
. Deploy a proxy of the API version to CloudHub.
. Apply the Rate Limiting Policy to the API as follows: Request Count greater than 1 for at least 1 consecutive minute.
+
. Add the alert described in the topic about how to add an alert.
. Call the API.
+
. Recall the API two more times (reload the page). Check that `API calls exceeded` appears if you called and recalled the API within the 1 minute period. Any additional page reload operations within the 1 minute period have no effect.
. Check that users, who you selected for email notification when you added the alert, actually receive email notifications.
. Check that the alert was resolved.
