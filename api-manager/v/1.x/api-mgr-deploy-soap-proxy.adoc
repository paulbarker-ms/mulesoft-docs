= To Set Up and Deploy a SOAP API

In this procedure, you set up an existing API by creating a proxy application in API Manager. You assign a name and a version designator to the application. API Manager creates an API version details page, which has controls for managing the application. You create and deploy a proxy in CloudHub if you have an account. 

. In Anypoint Platform, click API Manager.
+
. On the API Administration page, click Add new API.
. Enter a name, version, and brief description of your API. For example:
+
* API Name: Global Weather
* Version Name: 1.0.development
* Description: This API checks the weather forecast in cities around the world.
+
. Skip entering a URL for API Endpoint. This URL is not required at this point.
+
. Click Add.
. Click Configure Endpoint, under API Status.
. In Configure Endpoint, set the following options:
+
* Select Endpoint With A Proxy
* Type: Select WSDL
* Implementation URI: Enter the WSDL for the existing SOAP service, for example: `+http://www.webservicex.net/globalweather.asmx?WSDL+`.
* Configure Proxy For Cloudhub: Check this option.
+
If you don't want to deploy the proxy to CloudHub, download the proxy for deployment to another server using the control in Configure Endpoint.
+
. Save and deploy the proxy.
+
When deployment is complete, you can do the following:
+
* Consume the weather service by calling the proxy app at the URL, which appears in API Status and looks something like `+https://global-weather.cloudhub.io+`.
* Use Postman to simulate a SOAP request to the proxy.
* Apply policies to the proxy app in API Manager.
