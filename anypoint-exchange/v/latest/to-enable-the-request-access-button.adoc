= To Enable the Request Access Button to Display

This topic requires the Exchange Administrator role.

Users specify what applications can have access to an API by clicking the 
Request Access button image:ex2-request-access.png[Button - Request Access].

Exchange Administrators see the Request Access in the More Options menu image:ex2-more-options-icon.png[Button - More Options - 3 dot menu].

However, just creating an API asset does not cause the Request Access button to display.
You have to configure the asset first:

. In API Manager, click Manage API > Manage API from Exchange to open the API. 
. Use the URL of your API asset in Exchange as the Implementation URI in API Manager. 
. After opening your API in API Manager, you can view the API Instance ID value as well as other useful information. 
. To return to Exchange, click View API in Exchange. 
. In Exchange, the Request Access button appears in the three dot menu. 

Note: in API Manager, the API's Status is marked as Unregistered. To register the API, deploy the API to Runtime Manager; however, changing the API Status to Registered is not required for the API to be usable in Exchange.

== Request Access Display Criteria

To see the Request Access button in a public portal requires:

* A published API in Exchange of REST, SOAP, or HTTP API. The REST API can be either an OAS or RAML API specification.
* An instance created in API Manager with the API.
* Set the instance as public in the API Instances link.
* Set the instanceâ€™s URL in API Instances if not present.
