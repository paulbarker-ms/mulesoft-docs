= About Consuming an API

Anypoint Exchange provides significant features for API providers to easily publish and share APIs with developers inside and outside of an organization. 

Exchange helps API consumers understand API functionality and test features with:

* API console to view API functions. This console appears to the right of a REST API detail screen.
* API Notebook to view API documentation and to test API features.
* Simulate data to an API using the mocking service.
