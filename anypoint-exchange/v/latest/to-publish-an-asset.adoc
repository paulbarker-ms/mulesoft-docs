= To Publish Asset Draft Content

When an asset is created, Exchange requires that you click Publish to complete creating the asset.
Control then passes to the edit menu where you can add a description.

If you add a description, you need to publish the asset draft content so that the description is 
visible to users who utilize the asset. To publish the asset draft update, 
click Publish image:ex2-publish.png[Button - Publish in the task bar].

If this icon is not visible, click Go To Draft.

After updating the description, you can add tags, share your asset, or download a copy.
