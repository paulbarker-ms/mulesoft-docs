= To Search Using the Graph API
:keywords: query, exchange, exchange2, graph, api, graph api

The Exchange Graph API lets you search Exchange assets for a string value. You can specify what values
to receive in each search. 

Because the Graph API accesses Anypoint Exchange and Anypoint Platform, inquiries should 
have an access token if you want to access assets in private exchange. If you only search for MuleSoft public assets, you don't need an access token.

== To Obtain an Access Token

You only need an access token if you are searching for assets that are not created by MuleSoft.

Access tokens expire sometime between 15 to 180 minutes (ask your organization administrator), so you may need to get a new token while doing searches.

. Log into Anypoint Platform.
. Obtain an access token with a curl command such as the following. You can also use Postman or another application for sending HTTP commands. 
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
curl -X POST \
  https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "username": "YOUR_ANYPOINT_PLATFORM_USER_NAME",
  "password": "YOUR_ANYPOINT_PLATFORM_PASSWORD"
}'
----

== Graph API Access URL

You can access the Graph API at the `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/graph/api/v1/graphql+` URL. To search 
using the API, send a POST command containing the search string.

For example:

[source,json,linenums]
----
curl -X POST \
  https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/graph/api/v1/graphql \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query": "{ assets(query: { searchTerm: \"searchTerm\" }) { groupId, assetId, version } }"}'
----

The query field contains the GraphQL query, which allows fetching a lot more asset fields.

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  assets(asset: {groupId: "some-group-id", assetId: "some-asset-id", version: "some-version-1.2.3"}) {
    # Possible fields to retrieve
    groupId
    assetId
    version
    description
    name
    type
    tags {
      value
      key
    }
    createdBy {
      id
      userName
      firstName
      lastName
    }
    files {
      classifier
      packaging
      externalLink
      md5
    }
    rating
    numberOfRates
    createdAt
    organizationId
    assetLink
    runtimeVersion
    productAPIVersion
    dependencies {
      groupId
      assetId
      version
      name
      type
    }
    related(relationshipType: OtherVersions) {
      groupId
      assetId
      version
      name
      type
      runtimeVersion
      productAPIVersion
    }
  }
}
----

== To Search Only a Private Exchange

. Get the organization ID for the Private Exchange by clicking an asset in your Private Exchange.
+
An example URL is:
+
[source,xml]
----
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/42424242/product-api/1.0.0/
----
+
`42424242` is the organization ID.
+
. Add the organization ID using the organizationIds field. 
+
A single organization ID would be:
+
`organizationIds: ["42424242"]`
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  assets(
    query: {
      searchTerm: "product",
      organizationsIds: ["4141141", "32322", "2342345"]
    },
    latestVersionsOnly: true
  ) {
    assetId,
    description
  }
}
----
+
The output for this example is:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "data": {
    "assets": [
      {
        "assetId": "product-datatype",
        "description": "Product Datatype Asset"
      },
      {
        "assetId": "product-api",
        "description": "Product API Asset"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

== Reference: Query Filter Parameters

You can specify filters to display additional information about each asset. 

The following filters let you refine query output:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|assetId |Asset ID for each asset.
|createdAt |Date and time an asset was created, for example, 2017-08-11T04:48:20.585Z.
|createdBy { id, userName, firstName, lastName } |Display who created the asset.
|dependencies { groupId, assetId, version, name, type } |Returns the assets the listed asset depends on.
|files { classifier, packaging, externalLink, md5 } |File information. 
|name |Asset name
|numberOfRates |The number of star ratings for an asset.
|organizationId |Organization ID for an asset.
|rating |Star rating value for an asset.
|runtimeVersion |Mule Runtime version.
|tags { value, key, mutable } |The asset tags. The tags created in the user interface and when publishing are only `value` tags (they don't have a key). Tags created in the user interface are mutable while the others are immutable. Tags with a key and value are special tags created by Exchange to describe the asset.
|type |Lowercase values corresponding to the Exchange All Types menu: connector, template, example, rest-api, soap-api, raml-fragment, and custom.
|version |Version for an asset.
|groupId |Group ID for an asset.
