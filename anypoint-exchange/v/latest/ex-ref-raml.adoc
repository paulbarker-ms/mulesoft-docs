= Referencing a RAML File

To open a RAML in Anypoint Studio:

. In https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?type=rest-api[Anypoint Exchange], click the card for a REST API (RAML).
. In the Exchange details, click Download. This copies the RAML to your computer as a zip file.
. In Anypoint Studio, click File > New > Mule Project and in the New Mule Project dialog box, click *APIkit Settings* > Add APIkit Components and locate the RAML zip file on your computer. You can also download a RAML from the Anypoint Platform API Manager or Design Center.

The RAML imports and populates the new Mule project.
