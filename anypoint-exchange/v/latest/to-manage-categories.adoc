= To Manage Categories
:imagesdir: ./_images

Exchange Administrators and Organization Owners can create categories to group Exchange access types. 
Categories let users organize assets into different groups to improve asset browsing and discovery.

For example, a category called API Type with possible values `System API`, `Experience API`, 
and `Integration API` is applied to assets of type REST API, SOAP API, and HTTP API:

== To Create a Category

. In Anypoint Exchange, click Login and log into your organization.
. Click Settings in the left navigation area.
. Click Add New Category.
. Specify a category name. Each category name must be unique.
. Specify one or more values. Each category must have a value.
. Press the Return/Enter key or click the plus sign next to the value to confirm the value:

Note: If a plus sign is not clicked, the check mark to indicate the category has no 
effect.

. Choose the asset types that the category corresponds to.
. Click the checkmark to enable the category.

== To Apply a Category

. Click an asset in your organization. 
. In Categories in the right side details menu, click Add Category and choose the category and value from the drop-down menu. 

== To Access a Category

After creating a category and applying the category to one or more assets, 
in the Exchange search field, specify the `category:` search term and the category value to list the assets.

For example, to find assets of API Type, search for `category:"API Type" = "System API"`.

== To Change or Delete a Category

After you apply a category to an asset, to change or delete a category from the 
Settings menu, you need to open every asset you applied the category to and delete the category from the asset. 

After deleting the category you want to change or delete from all assets that you applied the category to, you can return to the Settings menu and change or delete the category.
