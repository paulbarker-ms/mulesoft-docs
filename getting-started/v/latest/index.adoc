:noindex:

Welcome to the Getting Started section, where you can familiarize yourself with the most popular Anypoint Platform tools that support everything you do with APIs and integration applications. The documentation in this section helps you work toward building reusable code to manage integration of your digital assets. The key to integrating digital assets is the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/whitepaper/api/api-led-connectivity[API-led approach].

[TIP]
If you have prior knowledge of APIs, you may want to know about link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/[Mule Runtime], MuleSoft's flagship integration platform. APIs can work with Mule applications in many ways. Try out link:/apikit/[APIkit] or create a  link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/anypoint-platform/#/portals[public developer portal] for customized access of APIs and other assets in your organization.

== Getting Started with APIs

. Find out link:/getting-started/design-an-api[How to Design an API].
. After designing the API, learn link:/getting-started/implement-and-test[How to Implement and Test an API].
. To bring your API to your organization or a larger audience, see link:/getting-started/sync-api-apisync[How to Sync an API to the Platform].

== Getting Started with Mule Applications

The documentation for Mule application development requires some familiarity with link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/index[Anypoint Studio]. Make sure you have it installed and get acquainted with it using the link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/basic-studio-tutorial[Basic Studio Tutorial].

[NOTE]
Install the link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/setting-up-your-development-environment[Anypoint Studio hardware and software requirements]. Browse link:/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange] to get resources or examples for the integration you want. You can access Exchange from the browser or within Anypoint Studio to retrieve any MuleSoft and partner-supported link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[connectors] to help you hook into SaaS applications like ServiceNow and Salesforce, or generic data structures like databases, files and object stores.

. link:/getting-started/build-a-hello-world-application[How to Create a Mule App]
. Try out the link:/getting-started/anypoint-connector[Anypoint Connector Tutorial] where you find out Mule applications can do anything you already do with SaaS apps with greater efficiency. The tutorial uses the Twitter service as an example, but you can plug in another connector of your choice.
. In a Mule application, it is important to be able to route messages to different places depending on their contents. See how to interact with a Mule message in link:/getting-started/mule-message[How to Work with a Mule Message] and learn about the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-message-structure[Mule 3.x message structure].
. Learn more about routing based on Mule message contents in link:/getting-started/content-based-routing[How to Route Mule Messages Based on Content].

[TIP]
link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave[DataWeave] is an essential tool that lets you weave complex data transformations into your Mule applications to quickly transform and map Mule message payloads to other data structures.

=== Getting Started with Deployment

. Use Runtime Manager to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[Deploy to Your Own Servers].
+
[NOTE]
Runtime Manager is more flexible in that it allows link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[hybrid] management of apps on-prem or in the cloud.
+
. Deploy apps to the MuleSoft cloud service in the CloudHub UI in the link:/getting-started/deploy-to-cloudhub[Deploy to CloudHub Tutorial].

Dive into more strategies to control how your Mule applications are run and managed starting from the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/installing[Installing and Deploying] documentation for Mule runtime.
