= Visual Design

_Requires November 2017 Release_

Design Center includes visual editing capabilities for RAML API design. If you know a little about REST APIs, you can specify methods and responses visually. RAML expertise isn't required. Design Center lowers the barrier to API specification languages. 

To define a restful endpoint using a GUI instead of writing RAML code, you populate a GUI with values for resources, including resource types, relationships, and HTTP methods. The GUI then generates the RAML specification. The editor prompts you to describe endpoints and properly indents your code.Â 

// You can then simulate calling the API without leaving the editor. You can use the mocking service for the simulation instead of connecting to an actual REST service. 

You can then publish to Exchange and test the design. The resulting RAML output file begins the API life cycle and API design collaboration. 

From visual design mode, you can move the API specification to the full-featured code view to enhance the design.

* Root properties
