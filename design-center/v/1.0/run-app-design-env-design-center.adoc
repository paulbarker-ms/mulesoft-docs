= About Running an App (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments

You can design an app to start executing with or without intervention from another app or a user. Using a trigger, such as HTTP Listener, requires that you or an app start the app. For example, you enter a path in a browser to start the app as described in the flow design basic procedures.

Using a trigger, such as Scheduler, executes and re-executes your flow without intervention according to the schedule you configure.

The status of the deployment appears at the top of Design Center.

When running a app on a schedule, you can pause the app to prevent it from re-executing endlessly.

Pausing an app keeps the workspace active and the CloudHub resources in use.
