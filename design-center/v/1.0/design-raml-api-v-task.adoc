= To Design an API Specification (Visual Design)

_Requires November 2017 Release_

This procedure covers how to begin designing an API with the visual editing capabilities of Design Center. The following tasks are involved:

* To design the RAML Root
* To design a data type
* To design a resource
* To simulate calling the API in visual mode
* To publish the API

The example API consumes the free online REST service JSONPlaceholder at `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+`. The oversimplified API just lists the comments that the service stores about a particular post. In a real-world situation, you design the API to handle responses for all common HTTP status codes: 200, 400, 401, 404, 405, 406, and 415. For simplicity, this topic covers how design the API to return only the HTTP status code 200 when receiving a valid request. 

To call the API, you enter the implementation URL of the API in a browser and add the ID of a post in the last component of the URL. Comments appear in the browser output.

As you design an API, keep in mind that your design is set to read-only mode if you are idle for 10 minutes. Assuming nobody obtained the lock while you were idle, just click Edit to unlock and continue.

== To Design the RAML Root

. In Anypoint Platform, click Design Center. Set up a project to create a new API specification:
+
* In Projects, click Create. Select API Specification.
+
* In New API Specification, type a name for your new project. For example, type *jsonplaceholder*. 
* Select Try API Designer's Visual Editing Capabilities.
+
image::vd-new-api.png[height=186,width=397]
+
* Click Create.
+
Fields of RAML root properties appear for you to fill in. 
+
image::api-info.png[height=193,width=339]
+
. In API Summary, set options as follows:
+
* In Title, enter an API title to replace _New API_. For example, enter *placeholder*.
* In Version, type a version of the API. For example, *0.1*.
* In Protocols, select HTTP or HTTPS. Select HTTP for this example.
* In Media Type, select the format of the data the API returns. For example, select application/json.
* In Base URI, type the following example URI:
+
`+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{num}/+`
+
{num} is the base URI parameter that represents the ID of a post.
+
. In Description, type a description of API using markdown. For example, type *Specify the id of the comment you want to retrieve.*
+
. Click Base URI Parameters.
+
image::add-base-uri-parameter.png[height=50,width=458]
+
. Define the Num base URI parameter: 
+
* Click Add Base URI Parameter.
+
Base URI Parameter Name and Type fields appear.
+
* In Base URI Parameter Name, replace newBaseUriParameter with an arbitrary name. For example: *Num*. 
* Change the default Required setting to unchecked. You do not want to require the user of the API to enter a parameter value. Instead, you will define a default in the event a parameter isn't entered.
* In Type, select a RAML scalar type. For example, select Integer.
* In Base URI Parameters, click Details >.
+
image::baseuri-details.png[height=67,width=387]
+
Fill in the fields to define RAML facets that restrict substitutes you can use for {num} in the URI. For example:
+
** In Description, replace the default value _Property description_ with a description of the Num property. For example, *The id of stored comments in posts.*
** In Format, select a value. For example, select int.
** In Minimum and Maximum, enter input range limits. For example, type *1* and *5*, respectively. To call the API, the parameter {num} must be a number between 1-5.
** In Default Number, enter *1*.
** In Example number, enter *3*.
** Accept the other defaults.
+
The generated RAML code appears in the RAML viewer as you make these entries.
