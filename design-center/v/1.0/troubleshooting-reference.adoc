= Troubleshooting

Error messages can appear in two places:

* The bottom-right corner of your screen displays error messages in red boxes.
+
When you see an error message in this location and you are unable to resolve the error, open a support case for Design Center and paste the content of the message into the support case.
* The top-right corner of your screen displays them between the *Run* and *Deploy* buttons.
+
The table below lists all of the error messages that can appear in this location, as well as the actions that you can take to resolve the errors.
