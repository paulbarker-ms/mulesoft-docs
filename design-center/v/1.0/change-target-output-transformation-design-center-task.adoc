= To Change the Target Output of a Transformation (Design Center)
:keywords:

By default, the Transform component directs output to the payload of the Mule message object. You can change the target of the transformation to a variable or attribute if you use Transform instead of DataWeave through the Map control of a field you are editing.

This procedure changes the target output of a transformation to an attribute:

. In Transform, in Output Payload, in the default-selected payload, click Edit Transformation.
+
image::edit-transformation.png[height=152,width=263]
. In Edit Transformation, select a type: Attributes, Payload, or Vars. For example, select Attributes, and Save.
+
In Output Attributes, the otherThing attribute and suggested type, number?, appears.
+
image::otherThing.png[height=146,width=333]

The output of the flow is now set to otherThing.

This procedure changes the target output of a transformation to a variable. This procedure assumes you set up a custom data type of type string in JSON format.

. Click Edit Transformation again, and in Type, select Vars.
. In Name, type a name for the variable, for example, *foo*, and Save.
. In the middle of the output pane, click Set Data Type.
. Select the custom string data type in JSON format that you set up earlier.
. Select Script, and replace null with the following script:
+
----
%dw 2.0

output application/java
---
"my script"
----
+
. Select Mappings.
. Select Output Vars - Foo > Edit Transformation.
+
image::output-vars.png[]
+
. In Type, select Payload, and Save.
+
The target output of the payload changes to "my script".


To remove the output attributes or variables:

In the Output pane, click image:trash.png[].
