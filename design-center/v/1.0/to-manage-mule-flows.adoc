= About Building and Managing Flows (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart

You can have multiple flows in a single project. For example, using two flows, each can have a different listener path. One flow executes when the listener detects that you entered the /users path in the browser. The other flow executes when you start the app using another the /todos path. Each flow is executed independently of each other. 

Click Flows + to add a flow to the project.

You can edit types to add a variable or to edit data types for the payload and attributes of the input and output of a flow. You can assign a different name a flow and delete the flow.
