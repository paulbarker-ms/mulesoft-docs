= To Simulate Calling the API (Mocking) in Visual Mode

_Requires November 2017 Release_

This procedure builds on designing the RAML root, a data type, and resource in visual design mode.

In this procedure, you simulate calling the API. If you turn on the mocking service and send a request to the API, the mocking service returns the example response you specified in the API. 

// When you turn off the mocking service, and repeat the request, the API returns actual data from the JSONPlaceholder service.

. In the RAML code pane, turn on the mocking service.

+
The base URI changes from the JSONPlaceholder service URL to a mocking service URL, such as `+https://mocksvc.mulesoft.com/mocks/fa886e6f-3112-441d-8804-672ab0823f54/posts/{num}/+`
+
. Click Try It next to RAML Viewer at the bottom of the RAML code pane.
+
If the method you are trying to test has errors, Try It for that method is disabled; otherwise, if there are parameters, as there are in this example, the Parameters prompt appears.
+
. Provide a parameter between 1 and 5. For example, enter 2.
+

. Click Send.
+
A status 200 and the example response you specified during design is returned.

// Per Martin, 1/8/2018 bug wipes out base uri when you turn on mocking service. Correct example-returned to show example returned from a posts resource instead of a comments resource.

////

REVISE TO SHOW POSTS examples.
. Turn off the mocking service.
+
The Base URI for the JSONPlaceholder service specified in the RAML root in the earlier task is now in effect.
. In URI Parameters, enter *3* and click Send.
+
A status 200 and actual data from JSONPlaceholder service appears. Comments about post 3 are returned.
