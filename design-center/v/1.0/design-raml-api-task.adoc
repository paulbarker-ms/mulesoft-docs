= To Design a RAML API Specification (Code View)

_Requires November 2017 Release_

This procedure covers how to design a simple API that consumes the free online REST service JSONPlaceholder. The API has two resources: `/users` and `/usersbyid`. The API design supports requesting information about all users, or using an HTTP query parameter, requesting information about a particular user. In a real-world situation, you design the API to handle responses for all common HTTP status codes: 200, 400, 401, 404, 405, 406, and 415. For simplicity, you include code only for the HTTP status code 200 for receiving a valid request. 

The complete code for this procedure to copy and paste appears at the end of this topic.

. In Anypoint Platform, click Design Center. Set up a project to create a new API specification:
+
* In Projects, click Create. Select API Specification.
+
* In New API Specification, type a name for your new project. For example, type placeholder. Click Create.
+
The project opens for design in the master branch. In Design Center, a branch is a fork of a project that cannot be merged. Two lines of code based on the title and version of the API appear in the RAML editor.
+
. In the RAML editor, go to the next blank line (3).
+
The possible entries you can make appear as options. Click to enter and correctly indent an option into the code.
+

+
If you don't see these options, click CTRL+space.
+
. At the root level, click Root > baseUri from the list of options. Enter 
`+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+`.
+
. Go to the next line of code, and include a resource in the RAML. Indent the resource at the same level as the `baseUri`.
+
For example, create a `/users` resource:
+
----
...
baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
/users:
----
+
. Use auto-completion to enter the GET method to retrieve the information defined in `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+`. 
+
* Put your mouse pointer on the line below /users.
* Indent one level.
* Enter Ctrl+Space.
+
image::design-autocomplete.png[get method,height=409,width=489]
+
* Select get.
. Add a description of the method on the next line. For example:
+
----
/users:
  get:
    description: Retrieve a list of all the users
----
. Include HTTP responses in the RAML for simulating the API:
+
----
responses:
      200:
        body:
----
+
At this point, the API definition looks like this:
+
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: placeholder
baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
/users:
  get:
    description: Retrieve a list of all the users.
    responses:
      200:
        body:
----
+
. Import a JSON example:
+
* On your file system, create a `user-example.json` having the following content:
+

+
* Choose File or ZIP, and browse to and import the user-example.json file. 
* In Files, select the name of the API specification placeholder.raml to go back to the RAML code. In the RAML editor, type add the following lines to the code:
+
----
...
      application/json:
        example: !include user-example.json

. At one indentation from the root, define the following resource:
