= To Dynamically Change the URL of a Request (Design Center)

This procedure builds on the procedure to create a basic Mule app. In that app, you requested data from a particular URL of a REST service. Now, you change the app to make a request to the URL you specify on-the-fly when you start the app. You configure the HTTP Request path using an expression. In the expression, you use the keyword from the query string that starts the app from a browser: 

`/getpath?<keyword>=users`

where

** getpath is the value of Path in the listener configuration. 
** users is the path known to the JSON Placeholder service that returns user data.
** <keyword> is configured a *path* for example.

. Open myproject, and in the Consume API flow, open HTTP Request.
+
image::change-http-request-config.png[change http request configuration]
+
. Click Change to change the configuration of HTTP Request.
+
* In General, in Path, click Function image:flow-designer-88d35.png[f of x key].
* Type the following text:
+
*attributes.* 
+
Pause to see a list of options.

image::options-list.png[list of available options for entry]
* Select queryParams, and then type a period followed by this keyword:
+
*path*
+
For example:
+
*attributes.queryParams.path*
+

+
. Click Run, and execute the flow:
+
* Click options image:run-app-design-env-design-center-2428b.png[] > Copy Link.
* Paste the link in a browser or client, and add the following path to the end of the link:
+
*/getpath?path=todos*
+
The HTTP Listener hears the request, and starts the app. The list of todos appears in the browser.
