:keywords: design center, api designer

* Why is Test for testing a component configuration sometimes disabled?
+
The test button is greyed out until the application worker is created.
Connectivity testing requires a worker running in the background.
+
* Do I need to upload a JDBC driver to connect to Oracle DB?
+
Yes
+
* If a database is listed out of the box, why do I need to upload drivers?
+
Due to legal restrictions, it’s necessary that you upload the driver. MuleSoft cannot distribute the drivers.
+
* When using the FTP connector, I'm not able to connect to my computer as host, though I am able to connect with my locally installed Filezilla client.
+
Mule Runtime isn’t able to connect to your local machine. Mule Runtime runs in a virtual worker on CloudHub.  The worker's local environment is the virtual machine itself.
+
* Why does my app show up as Paused in Design Center but looks green when viewed in the Runtime Manager?
+
The Pause option in Design Center doesn’t pause the CloudHub worker. Pause pauses the application that runs in it.
* Why do I sometimes not see metadata listed on things in the flow?
+
While the worker space is being created, metadata is not accessible. The processing of metadata can only be performed when the worker space is ready.
+
* How can I unassociate a custom data type that has been set up in the Transform without needing to remove Transform?
+
In Transform, select the tree root: payload, attributes, or vars (variables). Assuming you already assigned a custom data type, at the bottom of Input or Output pane, select Clear data type. 
+
* Can you use MEL expressions in Design Center?
+
Yes, do not click Function image:flow-designer-88d35.png[f of x key]. Wrap text in `#[]`.
