= To Handle Errors (Design Center)
:imagesdir: ./_images

You can put specific parts of a flow that are prone to errors inside Try. If an attempt to use the part of the flow in Try fails, Try can catch the errors and apply a fix or an alternative. Different types of errors can be handled differently.

When you place a connector component inside Try, you control what happens if an error occurs: send an error message, make corrections, or anything else that you can do in a flow.

. Add Try to a flow.

. Click image:arrange-cards-flow-design-center-e256e.png[add to Try] within Try.
. Add and configure components, for example a Database Insert operation.

. Provide a value for Type. Type a value or select from a list of all possible errors that can occur on the components within Try.

. To the right of the error type, click image:arrange-cards-flow-design-center-e256e.png[add to Try] and add components. Execution of these components occurs if the specific error is thrown.
