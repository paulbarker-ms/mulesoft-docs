This page provides information about Partner Manager Connector (PMC), including:

* <<Overview>>.
* <<Installing the Connector>>.
* <<Configuring the Connector>>.
* <<Supported Operations>>.

== Overview

PMC provides connectivity to Anypoint Partner Manager (APM). The connector allows the management of APM-enabled connectors from APM and tracking of B2B exchanges.

== To Install this Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

== Configuring the Connector

The method for configuring the connector depends on whether you want to have _payload_ (that is, message content) persistence and, if you do, what mechanism you use to facilitate it.

* <<Configuration Without Payload Persistence>>.
* <<Configuration Using Amazon S3 for Payload Persistence>>.
* <<Configuration Using a Mule Flow for Payload Persistence>>.

=== Configuration Without Payload Persistence

. From Anypoint Studio, select the *Global Elements* view and press *Create*.
. Enter _Partner Manager_ in the filter.
. Choose *Basic Configuration* and click *OK*.
. In the *API Key* attribute, enter your private API key which is generated from APM portal.
. Enter in the *Environment ID* attribute the CloudHub environment you want PMC to run in.
. Press *OK*.

=== Configuration Using Amazon S3 for Payload Persistence

. From Anypoint Studio, select the *Global Elements* view and press *Create*.
. Enter _Partner Manager_ in the filter.
. Choose *Amazon S3 File Storage* and click *OK*.
. In the *API Key* attribute, enter your private API key which is generated from APM portal.
. Enter in the *Environment ID* attribute the CloudHub environment you want PMC to run in.
. Enter the settings of the S3 bucket to be used for storing files. These settings are obtained from your AWS console.
. Press *OK*.

=== Configuration Using a Mule Flow for Payload Persistence

. From Anypoint Studio, select the *Global Elements* view and press *Create*.
. Enter _Partner Manager_ in the filter.
. Choose *Custom File Storage* and click *OK*.
. In the *API Key* attribute, enter your private API key which is generated from APM portal.
. Enter in the *Environment ID* attribute the CloudHub environment you want PMC to run in.
. Type in the name of the flow to be used for persisting files in the *Flow Name* attribute.
. Optionally, inside the File URL attribute, set a MEL expression to read the file URL from the message produced by the flow.
. Press *OK*.

== Supported Operations

The connector supports the following operations:

* <<Track Transmission>>.
* <<Track Document>>.
* <<Track Error>>.
* <<Resolve Routes>>.
* <<Start Transactions Replay>>.
* <<End Transactions Replay>>.
* <<Search>>.
* <<Propagate Endpoint Properties>>.
* <<Harvest Endpoint Properties>>.
* <<Harvest Document Properties>>.
* <<Lookup>>.
* <<Update Transaction Status>>.
* <<Retrieve Payload>>.
* <<Get Partnership By Identifiers>>.
* <<Get Events By Transaction ID>>.
* <<Start Errors Notification>>.
* <<End Errors Notification>>.
* <<Evaluate Transaction Release Status>>.
* <<Start Transactions Release>>.
* <<End Transactions Release>>.

=== Track Transmission

Track transmissions originating from sources other than APM-enabled connectors like
the filesystem. User-defined metadata can also be tracked as part of the transmission.
The connector expects metadata to be a _java.util.Map_. Nested maps represent nested metadata.
You have the option to define the map inline via the *Object Browser*, or alternatively,
specify from the attribute its location in the Mule message. The reserved key "label" can be used in
metadata to label a transmission. A transmission label allows you to easily distinguish
between different transmissions in APM portal.

=== Track Document

Track documents like XML documents. The _Document_ attribute must be set accordingly
for APM to inspect the document and perform tasks such as property extraction.
User-defined metadata can also be tracked as part of the document. The connector expects metadata to be
a _java.util.Map_. Nested maps represent nested metadata. You have the option to
define the map inline via the *Object Browser*, or alternatively, specify from the attribute its location in the
Mule message.  The reserved key "label" can be used in metadata to label a document.
A document label allows you to easily distinguish between different documents in APM portal.

=== Track Error

Track errors originating from transactions, documents, transmissions, or business processes. The origin of the error is
selected from _source_ attribute and the ID identifying the source is set in the _sourceId_ attribute.

=== Resolve Routes

Fetch routes that have a source channel matching the document type and transport type. An empty _java.util.List_ is
returned if no routes could be found.

=== Start Transactions Replay

Fetch replayable transactions and set them as replaying. Replaying transactions that have timed out
and are identified as such through the _Replaying Timeout_ attribute are included with the result set.

=== End Transactions Replay

Mark transactions, identified by the given list of transaction IDs, as replayed.

=== Search

Search a resource with https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-b2b/anypoint-partner-manager-api#partner-manager-query-language[APM's query language].

=== Propagate Endpoint Properties

Copy the transmission session's endpoint properties in the key *properties* to outbound properties.

=== Harvest Endpoint Properties

Read the Mule event's endpoint properties and place them in the transmission session under the key *properties*.

=== Harvest Document Properties

Read the Mule event's document properties and place them in the transmission session under the key *properties*.

=== Lookup

Find lookup entries matching the given set of name-value fields and table name. Set the _key_ attribute to ensure
no more than a single lookup entry is returned.

=== Update Transaction Status

Update a transaction's status to *ACTIVE* or *INACTIVE.

=== Retrieve Payload

Fetch a transmission or a document's raw content from the given URL using the security scheme configured in APM.

=== Get Partnership By Identifiers

Find a partnership by the partner's identifier.

=== Get Events By Transaction ID

Fetches the events (i.e., business document, transmissions, and error) of a transaction given its ID.

=== Start Errors Notification

Fetches notifiable errors and marks their notification status to _NOTIFYING_.

=== End Errors Notification

Marks the notification status of errors, identified by the given list of error IDs, to _NOTIFIED_.

=== Evaluate Transaction Release Status

Evaluates if the route has a status window and in that case sets the transaction's release status to ON HOLD or INACTIVE.

=== Start Transactions Release

Fetches releasable transactions and marks their release status to _RELEASING_.

=== End Transactions Release

Marks the release status of transactions, identified by the given list of transaction IDs, to _RELEASED_.
