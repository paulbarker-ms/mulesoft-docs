B2B Transaction Definition:: The full configuration that configures how a document is processed between two partners.

B2B transaction-processing solution:: Functionality that serves as a translation layer between internal systems and the various formats (X12, EDIFACT, XML, CSV, and others) and transport protocols (AS2, FTP/S, and others) commonly used in electronic transactions between companies.

B2B Transaction-Processing Framework:: B2B transaction-processing solution that enables developers to build a single set of link:/mule-user-guide[Mule Runtime] flows that can process a wide range of messages from many different partners by dynamically applying rules and configuration data stored in link:/anypoint-b2b/anypoint-partner-manager[Anypoint Partner Manager] (APM)

These properties are extracted and stored by the Tracking service.
