= View an Application Network

This topic describes how to use Anypoint Visualizer to view a graph of your application network.

The topology of the application network is automatically generated by Anypoint Visualizer. To maximize visualization readability, "consumer"
 nodes (i.e. nodes that only have outbound connections), are shown at the top, and all "backend systems" (i.e. nodes with inbound connections only) are shown at the bottom. All consumer nodes are grouped by ClientId when possible, and otherwise grouped under the "External Traffic" node.
 For the ClientId to be detected, the target application/API/proxy should have the "Client Id enforcement" policy.

When viewing or modifying a graph, Anypoint Visualizer provides the following functionality:

* Undo or redo changes:  use the undo/redo buttons at the bottom-left corner of the canvas to undo/redo your changes
* Zoom control: use the zoom in, zoom out and zoom fit buttons on the bottom-right corner of the canvas to control the zoom. You can also use scroll to zoom in and out.
* Pan the visualization: click and drag on the canvas to pan the visualization

== View Information About a Node in Your Network

When you select a node within the graph, Anypoint Visualizer displays information about the node in the details panel on the right-hand side of the application. This panel is divided into the following sections:

* **Details**: provides information about the node, including the layer the node is assigned to. You can change the layer from this section. See link:/anypoint-visualizer/layers[Use Layers in Anypoint Visualizer].
* **CPU Utilization**: displays a graph showing recent CPU utilization for the node.
* **Memory Usage**: displays a graph showing recent memory usage for the node.

From the details panel, you can rename a node by clicking the *Rename Node* button.

== View Information About a Connection in Your Network

When you select a connect within the graph, Anypoint Visualizer displays basic information about the connection in the details panel on the right-hand side of the application.

From the details panel, you can rename the connection by clicking the *Set Edge Name* button.
