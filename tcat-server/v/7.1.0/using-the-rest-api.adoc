= Using the REST API
:keywords: tcat, rest, api

The REST API for Tcat Server provides a way for you to programmatically access much of Tcat's functionality. It allows you to:

* Register new servers
* Manage existing servers
* Manage server groups
* Restart servers
* Access and manage files on servers
* Create and manage deployments

To use the API, you can use any HTTP client. All APIs use JSON as the data format.

[TIP]
====
Already familiar with the API? Jump straight to the operations:

* <<Operations for Servers>>
* <<Operations for Server Groups>>
* <<Operations for Deployments>>
====

If you are using Java, we recommend the Jersey client or Apache HttpClient with Jackson for JSON support.

== Status Codes and Error Handling

When you call the REST APIs, the following status codes are returned:

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Status Code |Description
|200 |The operation was successful.
|201 |The resource (for example, server, server group, deployment) was created. The Location header  contains the location of the resource.
|404 |The resource was not found.
|409 |When creating a resource (for example, server, server group, deployment), a resource with that name already existed.
|500 |The operation was unsuccessful. See the HTTP body for details.
|===

When errors occur (for example, a 500 status code), the HTTP response  contains a JSON response with an error message. For example:

[source, code, linenums]
----
500
Content-Type: application/json
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Date: Mon, 10 Aug 2015 00:12:55 GMT

{
  message : "Could not connect to remote server."
}
----

== Working with Servers

The server API allows you to find, create, update, and delete servers. You can also perform operations related to managing a server such as restarting it or uploading files to it.

All resources/methods that return or accept a type, except where noted, use the server JSON type, which looks like this:

[source, code, linenums]
----
{
  "id" : "1234567890",
  "href" : "http://localhost:8080/console/api/servers/1234567890",
  "name" : "DevelopmentServer1",
  "type" : "Apache Tomcat/6.0.20",
  "hosts" : [ "http://192.168.1.105:8090", "http://192.168.1.105:8010" ],
  "environmentVariables" : [
    {
      "JAVA_OPTS : "-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize:1024m",
    }
  ],
  "groups" : [
    {
      "name" : "Development",
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/console/api/serverGroups/73d89173-290e-4cb3-a61c-e11deb74767d"
    }
  ],
  "deployments" : [
    {
      "name" : "Test",
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/console/api/deployments/local$fb9dcb67-88de-482a-b0a4-50ff1d65a16a"
    }
  ]
}
