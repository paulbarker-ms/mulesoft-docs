== Tcat Server 6 Release 2

=== 6 R2 New Features

Tcat Server 6 R2 includes several new features, including the following:

* *Fine-grained server commands*: The new Tcat6 command-line script allows you to start, stop, restart, and get status for a server on Windows or Linux. For more information, see link:/tcat-server/v/7.1.0/installation[Starting and Stopping on Windows and Linux].
* *Remote Server Restart*: You can now restart any Tomcat instance you manage with Tcat Server. For more information, see link:/tcat-server/v/7.1.0/working-with-servers[Working with Servers].
* *Reliable Tomcat restarts*: Tcat Server goes above and beyond Tomcat's functionality and ensures that when you restart Tomcat, the server stops completely before the restart occurs, preventing cases where the original Tomcat JVM would still be running and create a conflicting Tomcat JVM. This functionality is inherent in all the Tcat Server stop and restart commands described above.
* *Remote File Management*: For any server you manage with Tcat Server, the new Files tab allows you to view the files on that server, edit and redeploy any of its text-based (non-binary) files, and then restart the server. For more information, see link:/tcat-server/v/7.1.0/monitoring-a-server[Working with the Server Configuration Files].
* *Environment Variable Control*: You can now manually set environment variables on a Tcat Server instance, local or remote, through the Tcat Server console. For more information, see link:/tcat-server/v/7.1.0/monitoring-a-server[Working with Environment Variables].
* *Server Profiles*: You can now use server profiles to set environment variables and configuration files on multiple Tomcat instances simultaneously, providing a central point of storage for this data and easy centralized updates of the remote servers. For more information, see link:/tcat-server/v/7.1.0/working-with-server-profiles[Working with Server Profiles].
* *REST API*: The REST API provides programmatic access to Tcat Server functionality, including registering new servers, managing servers and groups, restarting servers, managing files on remote servers, and creating and managing packages. For more information, see link:/tcat-server/v/7.1.0/using-the-rest-api[Using the REST API].
* *Expanded Platform Testing*: Tcat Server 6 R2 has been tested on the following operating systems:
** Windows: XP, Server 2K3, Vista, Server 2K8, 7
** Linux: RHEL 4 & 5, CentOS 4 & 5, Fedora 6 through 12, Ubuntu 9.x, SUSE 10 & 11, openSUSE 10 & 11
** Mac OS X: 10.5.8 and 10.6

=== 6 R2 Known Issues

* (Since R2) When installing Tcat Server on Windows, the Start menu items are always installed in the group "Tcat Server 6" regardless of what Start menu group name you enter in the installer. Therefore, if you install multiple instances of Tcat Server on the same machine, you will only be able to use these Start menu items to start and stop the last instance installed. To work around this issue, use the `tcat6 start` command from the `bin` directory at the command prompt to start your other instances.
* (Since R2) When the Logs tab is selected on a Mac OSX system no files are displayed. Currently, there is no workaround to this issue.
* If you are connected to a network via VPN, Tcat Server does not auto-detect unregistered servers. To work around this issue, disconnect from VPN before starting Tcat Server, or add the servers manually as described in "Working with Servers" in the Tcat Server User's Guide.
* When servers are registered, they are registered with a specific IP address. If you are testing on a laptop with a wireless connection and you move from one location to another, your IP address might change, and the servers will no longer be able to communicate with Tcat Server. In this case, you must unregister and reregister the servers with the current IP address.
* If you are running Internet Explorer 7 on Windows 2008, you can log in to Tcat Server but the main screen does not appear. To work around this, choose File > Add this site to... > Trusted Sites.
* If you navigate to another tab while a package is being deployed, the deployment is interrupted. To work around this issue, wait for a package to be deployed before navigating elsewhere.
* If you increase the font size on Mozilla Firefox, the monitoring and diagnostic screens disappear. To work around this issue, leave the font size set to the default.
* When viewing the details of an application, the Session Search link on the Sessions sub-tab currently does not function properly.
* If you download the installer more than once, Firefox appends parentheses to the file name, which causes problems when you try to run the installer. If you must download the installer again, delete the original file first so that Firefox leaves the original name intact.
