= Audit Logging
:keywords: anypoint platform, configuring, logs, auditing

Changes made by users within an Anypoint Platform organization are logged through an audit logging service. You can access the data logs through the Audit Logging Query API or through the Audit Logging UI.

The audit logging service provides a queryable history of actions performed within the Anypoint platform. It keeps track of all users who have interacted with objects in the system, timestamping these actions. It also provides mechanisms for querying the set of users who have performed actions, the set of objects that have had actions performed on them, and other endpoints that enable the querying of log entries.

Audit logs have a retention period of six years. To maintain your log files longer, you should download them periodically.

== To Access Audit Logging

Users belonging to the *Organization Administration* role or the *Audit Log Viewer* role on the Anypoint Platform have access to both the UI and the Query API. The audit log service is business group aware, meaning, you will see only logs that are relevant to your own business group. The audit log UI is embedded in Access Manager, if you are not an Organization Administrator, but you have the Audit Log Viewer role, then you can only see the audit log user interface under Access Manager.

To view the audit logs, log into Anypoint Platform and click *Access Management*. You can also press the Escape key on your keyboard to view the Anypoint Platform navigation menu.

From the Access Management menu, select *Audit Log*

== About Log Contents

Activities represented in the log are actions that occur at a particular time, involve one or more objects, have an action type (such as 'delete' or 'approve') associated with the objects, and optionally a payload which can store application-specific information such as changed fields, environment information, etc.

Each log entry has a set of properties that provides information about the activity:

* *Time*: The timestamp when the activity occurred.
* *Product*: The product where the object resides. Example: "Access Management"
* *Type*: The type of the object on which the action is performed. Example: "Organization"
* *Action*: The Action associated with the object. Example: “Create”
* *Object*: The name of the Object. Example: “foo”
* *User*: The User who performed the action. Example: “johndoe”
* *Parent*: (Optional) The parent of the object (if any) on which the action is performed. Mainly relevant to APIs.
* *Payload*: (Optional) More information about the log properties. Example: If an Organization was created, then the payload would contain information about organization and the owner such as IDs.

The following is a list of actions per Product and Object type that Anypoint Platform audits:

== To Query Audit Logging for Anypoint MQ

link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] logs
Anypoint MQ actions for creating and maintaining queues,
exchanges, and client applications. These actions appear in the
*Access Management* > *Audit Logging* service.

=== About Anypoint MQ Audit Logs

The Audit Log screen with Anypoint MQ actions appears as follows:

image:mq-audit-logs.png[mq-audit-logs]

*Note:* After setting the *Products*, *Types*, or *Actions* filters, click *Apply filters*.

You can also search by object name or user.

=== About Actions

These actions are tracked:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Queues: |Exchanges: |Applications:
|`Create queue` +
`Delete queue` +
`Modify queue` +
`Purge queue` +

|`Create exchange` +
`Delete exchange` +
`Modify exchange` +
`Create binding` +
`Delete binding`

|`Create client` +
`Delete client` +
`Regenerate client`
|===

*Notes:*

* Changing attributes of a queue causes the `Modify queue` action.
* A queue is distinctly identified as a FIFO queue only when creating a FIFO queue.
* Sending, receiving, or browsing messages do not count as auditable actions.
* Audit logging does not record failed Anypoint MQ operations as failed in the audit logs.

For each action, you can download a payload file (`payload.txt`) to your computer
that provides JSON-formatted information describing all MQ settings.

=== About Payloads

A payload is JSON-formatted text that lists all MQ settings that occur when
an action is audited. When you click the blue payload button, Anypoint
Platform downloads the `payload.txt` to your computer.

The following example shows a formatted version of the
contents of `payload.txt` after creating a queue:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
	"organizationId":"<organization_ID>",
	"environmentId":"<environment_ID>",
	"objectName":"MyQ",
	"userName":"MyUserName",
	"objectId":"MyQ",
	"regionId":"us-west-2",
	"defaultTtlMillis":604800000,
	"defaultLockTtlMillis":120000,
	"encrypted":false,
	"deadLetterQueueId":"DLQ",
	"maxDeliveries":10,
	"fifo":true
}
----

The possible fields in `payload.txt` are:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|organizationId |Organization ID for the current Anypoint Platform account.
You can use the organization ID to access link:/anypoint-mq/mq-apis[Anypoint MQ REST APIs].
|environmentId |Environment ID for the current Anypoint Platform account.
You can use the environment ID to access link:/anypoint-mq/mq-apis[Anypoint MQ REST APIs].
|objectName |Name of the queue, exchange, or client application.
|UserName |Username for the Anypoint Platform account.
|objectId |Name of the queue, exchange, or client application. (Same value as objectName.)
|regionId |Region location where you process your Anypoint MQ connections.
|defaultTtlMillis |Default time to live in milliseconds how long unprocessed messages persist before being deleted.
|defaultLockTtlMillis |Default lock time to live in milliseconds for the queue or exchange you create.
The duration in milliseconds that a message is unavailable to other applications before being put back into the queue.
|encrypted |If the queue or message exchange is encrypted. Anypoint MQ uses PBE
with MD5 and triple DES to encrypt messages.
|deadLetterQueueId |The name of the dead letter queue to which the current object is associated.
|maxDeliveries |Indicates how many attempts Anypoint MQ tries to deliver messages in the queue before rerouting the message to the dead letter queue.
|fifo |Indicates that this is a link:/anypoint-mq/mq-queues#fifoqueues[FIFO] queue.
*Note:* This field is only set to `true` when you create a FIFO queue.
Any subsequent changes to the FIFO queue causes the `fifo` field to be set to `null`.
|===

=== About Sample Use Cases

A few of the reasons you may want to use Audit Logs:

* Determine all MQ actions of a user.
* Determine all MQ actions to an object and by whom.

=== About Audit Log REST API Access

You can access the
link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/anypoint-platform/#/portals/organizations/68ef9520-24e9-4cf2-b2f5-620025690913/apis/24562/versions/26089/pages/39846[Audit Log REST API] from the Audit Logging Query API and its
link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/repository/v2/organizations/68ef9520-24e9-4cf2-b2f5-620025690913/public/apis/24562/versions/26089/files/root[RAML].

The following are example `curl` commands for accessing the API (Windows users need to download `curl` before using these commands).
