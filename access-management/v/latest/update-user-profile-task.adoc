= To Update Your User Profile 

When you log into the configured IdP for the first time, an Anypoint user is created using the your IdP information. Your user profile includes a username, your name, and email address. Typically, the OpenID Connect `userinfo` endpoint provides a `preferred_username` claim that contains the authenticated userâ€™s username. However, some IdPs such as OpenAM and PingFederate do not support the `preferred_username` claim. Therefore, when Anypoint Platform creates a user, the email and subclaims values comprise the username if the `preferred_username` claim isn't present.

To update user profile information from your configured IdP, log into Anypoint Platform through the IdP. Your user profile information is updated within Anypoint Platform using the updates from the IdP.
