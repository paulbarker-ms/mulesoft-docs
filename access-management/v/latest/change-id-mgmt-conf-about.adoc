= To Change an Identity Management Configuration 

If any information needs to be changed after submitting the External Identity - Identity Management configuration form for OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0, log into the MuleSoft Support Portal and submit a request. 

The `email` `firstname` and `lastname` fields of the SAML configuration are updated automatically every time a user signs into the IdP using the value in the `username` field.
