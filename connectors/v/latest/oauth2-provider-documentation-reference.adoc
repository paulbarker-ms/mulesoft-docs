= OAuth2 Provider Module Documentation Reference

The OAuth2 Provider Module allows a Mule Application to be configured as an Authentication Manager in an OAuth2 Dance.
With this role, the application will be able to authenticate previously registered clients, grant tokens and validate them or register and delete clients, all during the execution of a flow.


[WARNING]
The following documentation assumes a basic knowledge of the OAuth2 authorization protocol. If you are not familiar with it, the RFC specification can be found in: link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[RFC6749] +
Also, if the app should behave as the *Client in the OAuth2 Dance*, then the link:oauth-documentation[OAuth Module] should be used.

Since the OAuth dance is done through HTTP, the OAuth2 Provider makes use of the link:http-connector[Mule HTTP Connector].
As a consequence, apart from the definition of an OAuth2 provider configuration , the mule application must also have an HTTP Listener configuration to be used by the provider.

Once configured, the provider works as follows:

Two HTTP endpoints are created for listening to Authentication Code and Token request as stated by the OAuth2 definition. Those will work independently from the mule application and will respond via HTTP. +
Apart from that, the provider defines an operation: <<validate-token>> that can check if a token is authorized. That operation can be added anywhere in a flow to control it's execution. If the token is indeed authorized,
the flow will keep executing, setting token information in the payload, otherwise, a *TOKEN_UNAUTHORIZED* error will be raised. It's up to the developer to add that operation in parts of the application that need token authorization. +
Also, since token validation is almost always going to be used together with an HTTP Listener, in case it fails, the listener's response mechanism can handle that error and properly respond to the requester. Additional logic can be added handling that type of Error. +
Lastly, additional operations are provided to add or delete clients and to revoke tokens in case it's needed.

=== Security Providers

As seen in the <<general-configuration>>, two security providers should be defined in the application to be later referenced by the OAuth2 Configuration element.

One way of doing this is by using the Spring Framework, defining both security providers and then using the link:spring-module[Spring Module] to add them to the Mule Security Manager as so:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<spring:security-manager>
    <spring:delegate-security-provider name="clientSecurityProvider"
                                       delegate-ref="clientAuthenticationManager"/>
    <spring:delegate-security-provider name="resourceOwnerSecurityProvider"
                                       delegate-ref="resourceOwnerAuthenticationManager"/>
</spring:security-manager>
----

=== Client Validation Rate Limiter

Allows to configure a mechanism to prevent the continuous client validation when it's using invalid credentials.

As for this moment, only a  `period-rate-limiter` is implemented that handles rate limiting based on a time period.

==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Duration | Number | The time to wait before resetting the rate limiter. That means that during time intervals of _duration_ length, every time a client validation fails, it will be added to the failure count | 600 | {nbsp}
| Duration Time Unit | Time Unit | The time unit for the duration attribute | SECONDS | {nbsp}
| Maximum Failure Count | Number | Maximum number of failures allowed within the period before preemptively rejecting requests | 5 | {nbsp}
|======================


=== Authorization Code Configuration

Configuration related to authorization code handling and the authorization endpoint.

==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Login Page | String | Relative file path to the web page for the resource owner to provide it's credentials  | www-static/auth.html | {nbsp}
| Path | String | The Url relative path to the authorization endpoint in the HTTP server for listening to authorization requests | /authorize | {nbsp}
| Authorization Code Store | Object Store | A reference to a globally defined object store or a definition of a private object store. It's used to store generated authorization codes | A persistent object store created from the ObjectStoreManager with an entry TTL of 600 SECONDS | {nbsp}
|======================

=== Token Configuration

Configuration related to token handling and the token endpoint.

==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Path | String | The Url relative path to the token endpoint in the HTTP server for listening to token requests | /token | {nbsp}
| Token Store | Object Store | A reference to a globally defined object store or a definition of a private object store. It's used to store generated tokens | A persistent object store with an entry TTL of 86400 SECONDS | {nbsp}
| Token Ttl | Number | The time for a granted token to be considered valid after granting it. The value should be the same as the entryTtl of the token store if a custom one is configured | 86400 | {nbsp}
| Token Ttl Time Unit | Time Unit | The Time Unit to use for the token TTL. It should be the same as the entryTtlTimeUnit of the token store if a custom one was configured | SECONDS | {nbsp}
| Refresh Token Strategy | Refresh Token Strategy | Configures how refresh tokens should be handled in every refresh token request | No Refresh Token | {nbsp}
|======================

==== Refresh Token Strategy

The refresh token strategy configures how refresh tokens are granted and how they should be handled every time a refresh token request is executed.

===== No Refresh Token

There will be no refresh token granted with every access token. As a consequence,  when a refresh token request comes, it will always be rejected.

===== Single Refresh Token

For every new access token that is granted, a single refresh token will be associated with it. That same refresh token should be used every time the access token is refreshed.

====== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Object Store | Object Store | A reference to a globally defined object store or a definition of a private object store. It's used to store generated refresh tokens | A persistent object store created from the ObjectStoreManager with an entry TTL of 86400 SECONDS | {nbsp}
|======================

===== Multiple Refresh Token

A new refresh token will be generated every time a refresh token request is executed. After that, the previous refresh token will be invalidated.

====== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Object Store | Object Store | A reference to a globally defined object store or a definition of a private object store. It's used to store generated refresh tokens | A persistent object store created from the ObjectStoreManager with an entry TTL of 86400 SECONDS | {nbsp}

== Operations

[[validate-token]]
=== Validate Token
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<oauth2-provider:validate-token config="OAuthProviderConfiguration"
                                token="#[vars.accessToken]"
                                scopes="#[vars.scopes]"
                                resourceOwnerRoles=#[vars.resourceOwnerRoles]/>
----

Validates that the given token was granted and is in a valid state. Also, if defined, checks that the token scopes or resource owner roles match the provided ones.

If the token provided is valid then the operation will set the payload as a JSON with the following information.
[options="header"]
|============
| Key | Value | Always
| expires_in | time remaining for the token to be considered invalid, in seconds | yes
| scope | space separated scopes associated with the token | yes
| client_id | Id of the client that requested this token | only if present
| username | Username of the resource owner that authorized this token to be requested | only if present
|============

In case you want to preserve the payload set before executing the operation, the attributes _target_ and _targetValue_ can be used to set this JSON information in a variable instead of overwriting the payload.
