= To Consume a REST Service (Design Center)

You can design an app to consume a REST service by setting up HTTP Listener and Request operations. In this procedure, you first consume a REST API service. Next, you test the HTTP request. You edit the Request configuration to make a secure HTTPS request. Finally, you test the HTTPS Request.

. In a new project, set up the HTTP Listener for a message from the browser to start this app: Use the default CloudHub HTTP configuration and set Path to */trigger*.
. Click + to add another component to the flow, and select HTTP Request.
. In HTTP Request, in General, set Path Or URL to `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users+`. In Advanced, set Allowed Methods to GET. Accept the other default settings and close the configuration. 
. Click Deploy, and the execute the flow:
+
* Click Copy Link.
* Paste the link in a browser or client, and type */trigger* at the end.
+
The HTTP Listener hears the request, and starts the app. The list of JSON Placeholder users appears in the browser.
+
. Open HTTP - Request, and click Output. 
+
The list of users appears in Payload, and in Payload > Attributes, the attributes you can use in DataWeave expressions appear. 
+
. Click Configuration > Edit, and configure the following options:
* In HTTP Configuration, in Protocol, select HTTPS.
* In Port, enter *443*
* Save.
. In HTTP Request, change Path Or URL as follows:
+
* FROM: `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users+`
* TO: `+https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users+`
. Click Deploy. Fire the app trigger:
+
* Select Copy Link.
* Paste the link in a browser or client, and type */trigger* at the end.
+
The list of users appears in Payload, and in Payload > Attributes, the attributes you can use in DataWeave expressions appear.
