The Salesforce connector provides two operations that are useful for getting custom event notifications. These notifications pertain to general events that are not tied to Salesforce data changes.

. Create a streaming channel with the Publish Channel operation.
+
A `StreamingChannel` is a special Salesforce object that represents a channel used for notifying listeners of generic Streaming API events.
+
Note that you can also create a streaming channel through the Salesforce or through Workbench.
+
. Subscribe to the channel through the Subscribe Channel operation.
+
The Salesforce connector converts the custom events in your streaming channel to Mule events and dispatches them to your flows.

////
Generic streaming in Salesforce allows you to push and receive custom events you define, in a secure and scalable way. Generic streaming uses Streaming API to send notifications of general events that are not tied to Salesforce data changes.
