= Example: To Add a Fund to the Financial Management Service
:keywords: anypoint studio, connector, workday, wsdl

This example uses the Invoke operation in the Workday connector to insert a fund to the Financial Management service.

. Create a Mule application as a Design Center or Studio 7 Mule project.
+
. Add and configure a trigger, such as the HTTP Listener or Scheduler, for a flow in your app.
+
You can accept the default settings for the HTTP Listener or Scheduler and provide any required values.
. Add a Transform component to your flow, and use the field within the Script tab to add a DataWeave transformation script.
+
Example:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/xml
ns ns0 urn:com.workday/bsvc
---
{
  ns0#Put_Fund_Request @(ns0#Add_Only: true, ns0#version: "v28.0"): {
    ns0#Fund_Data: {
      ns0#Fund_Name: "I.M.F",
      ns0#Fund_Type_Reference: {
        ns0#ID @(ns0#'type': 'Fund_Type_ID'): "FUND_TYPE-6-3"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
+
. Add Workday-Invoke operation after the Transform component.
. From the Invoke operation, configure, test, and save a connection to the Workday server.
+
Configuration example:
+
* Configuration Name: `My Workday Connection`
* Username: `my_workday_username`
* Password: `my_workday_password`
* Tenant Name: `my_workday_tenant_name`
* Host Name: Defaults to `impl-cc.workday.com`
+
. In the General side-tab of the Invoke operation, provide Web Service Configuration parameters.
+
Example:
+
* Service: `Financial Management`
* Operation: `Put_Fund`
+
. Add a Logger to the end of your flow that takes a `payload` (or `#[payload]`) as the message.
. Deploy or Run your app.
. Once the status is Running, check for the response.
+
If you are using the HTTP Listener, you can browse to your listener URL, for example: `http://<app_url>:8081/fund`.
+
If you are using the Scheduler, you can find the response in the logs.
+
You should receive an XML response similar to this snippet:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<wd:Put_Fund_Response xmlns:wd="urn:com.workday/bsvc" wd:version="v28.0">
    <wd:Fund_Reference wd:Descriptor="I.M.F">
        <wd:ID wd:type="WID">THE_WID_ID_NUMBER</wd:ID>
        <wd:ID wd:type="Fund_ID">FUND-6-399</wd:ID>
    </wd:Fund_Reference>
</wd:Put_Fund_Response>
