[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| * <<hdfs_kerberos, Kerberos>>
* <<hdfs_simple, Simple>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime will actually purge the instances when it sees it fit. |  |

==== Connection Types
[[hdfs_kerberos]]
===== Kerberos



[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Username a| String |  Kerberos principal. It is passed to HDFS client as the "hadoop.job.ugi" configuration entry. It can be overriden by values in configurationResources and configurationEntries. We call it username for backward compatibility reasons in terms of what will be seen in xml |  |
| Keytab Path a| String |  Path to the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/keytab_def.html">keytab file</a> associated with username. It is used in order to obtain TGT from "Authorization server". If not provided it will look for a TGT associated to username within your local kerberos cache. |  |
| Name Node Uri a| String |  The name of the file system to connect to. It is passed to HDFS client as the {FileSystem#FS_DEFAULT_NAME_KEY} configuration entry. It can be overriden by values in configurationResources and configurationEntries. |  | x

| Configuration Entries a| Object |  A java.util.Map of configuration entries to be used by the HDFS client. Here you can provide additional configuration entries as key/value pairs. |  |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment will fail if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy |  |
|===

[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Username a| String |  User identity that Hadoop uses for permissions in HDFS.  When Simple Authentication is used, Hadoop requires the user to be set as a System Property called HADOOP_USER_NAME. If you fill this field then the connector will set it for you, however you can set it by yourself. If the variable is not set, Hadoop will use the current logged in OS user. |  |
| Name Node Uri a| String |  The name of the file system to connect to. It is passed to HDFS client as the {FileSystem#FS_DEFAULT_NAME_KEY} configuration entry. It can be overriden by values in configurationResources and configurationEntries. |  | x
| Configuration Resources a| Array of String |  A java.util.List of configuration resource files to be loaded by the HDFS client. Here you can provide additional configuration files. (for example, core-site.xml) |  |
