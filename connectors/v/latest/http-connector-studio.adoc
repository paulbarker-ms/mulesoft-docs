= About the HTTP Connector (Studio)
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, connectors, http, https, http headers, query parameters, rest, raml

Using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, the HTTP connector performs one of the following operations:

* Listener
+
Starts executing the Mule flow upon receiving an HTTP request.
+
* Request
+
Consumes an HTTP service.
+
* Basic security filter
+
Secures and authenticates requests to your service.
+
* Load a static resource
+
Brings a resource, such as a script, from the file system into your app to be return by a Listener.

From Mule Palette, you drag and drop an HTTP connector to a new flow. An error state occurs until you configure the host, port, and path. You can quickly configure an app to consume an HTTP service using the two HTTP connector instances as follows:

* Listener configuration: Path = `/somepath`, for example
* Request configuration: Path Or URL = the URL of the HTTP service you want to consume

You run the app and enter the URL ending in `/somepath` in the browser. The listener detects the request, and the flow executes.

You can configure the HTTP connector to send or receive HTTPS requestsÂ using Transport Level Security (TLS).
