= To Read a File Using the SFTP Connector

:toc-title:

The SFTP connector can read a file at any point in the flow, unlike in Mule 3, where the transport can only read files as a result of inbound endpoint polling.

Here is the syntax for reading a file:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sftp:read path="#[path]"
  lock="true|false"
  outputEncoding="UTF-8"
  outputMimeType="application/xml" />
----

The operation above reads the file in the given path. It returns a Mule message (`MuleMessage`) with the following attributes:

* The file's content as the payload.
* The file's metadata in the message attributes.
* If the file does not exist, you receive a `SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH` error. Note that the operation does not read directories.
