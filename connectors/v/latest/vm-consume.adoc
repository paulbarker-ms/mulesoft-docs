This procedure shows how to publish a message that is received in a different flow.

. Define a flow with a `<vm:listener>` as a message source, for example:
+
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<vm:config name="vm">
    <vm:queues>
        <vm:queue queueName="myQueue" queueType="PERSISTENT" />
    </vm:queues>
</vm:config>

<flow name="listener">
   <vm:listener queueName="myQueue" config-ref="vm" />
   <flow-ref name="yourIntegrationLogic"/>
</flow>
----
+
. Feed messages into the newly created queue.
+
For example, assume that a flow is triggered by an HTTP request with a JSON payload and that you want to extract the `body` attribute of that JSON object and publish it to the queue:
+
[source, xml, linenums]
----
    <flow name="publish">
        <http:listener path="/json-here" allowedMethods="POST" config-ref="httpListener" />
        <vm:publish queueName="myQueue">
            <vm:content>#[payload.body]</vm:content>
        </vm:publish>
        <logger/>
    </flow>
----
+
In this example, you can see:
+
* The `publish` operation references the queue created in the `config`.
* The `content` parameter allows you to use DataWeave to build the value to send (without having side effects on the message). Note that if you do not not specify a `content`, the entire payload will be sent.
* The `publish` operation is one-way. Once the message is posted into the queue, the flow continues. The processing on the listening side happens asynchronously. You do not receive a notification about its outcome.
* The `queueName` specified in the `publish` operation must have a matching `<vm:listener>` element that points to the same queue. If you attempt to publish to a queue for which no listener exists, an error will be raised. This behavior prevents message loss caused by sending messages into a queue that nobody is listening to.
