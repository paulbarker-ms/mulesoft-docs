The connector also provides the ability to copy and move files or directories on demand.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sftp:copy sourcePath="source.txt"
  targetPath="backup" overwrite="true|false"
  createParentDirectories="true|false"
  renameTo="renamed.txt"/>
<sftp:move sourcePath="source.txt"
  targetPath="backup"  overwrite="true|false"
  createParentDirectories="true|false" 
  renameTo="renamed.txt"/>
----

Notice the `targetPath` and `renameTo` parameters:

* `targetPath` is the path to the directory into which the file is to be copied or moved. This path must point to a directory.

* `renameTo` is an optional parameter that renames the file as part of the operation. This parameter must be a file name, not a path. If this attribute is not provided, the original file name is retained.
