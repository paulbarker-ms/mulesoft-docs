= Java Module
:keywords: Java, custom code

The Java module in Mule 4 intends to:

* Minimize the need for custom code.
* Avoid the need for you to know or understand Java.

However, advanced some uses cases exist require integrating with custom Java code, for example:

* Need to reuse a tax calculation library.
* Need to reuse a canonical object model that is standard in the organization.
* Need to execute custom logic and Java is your weapon of choice.

Note that in Mule 3, MEL was used as a bridge for creating instances of particular Java classes and executing Java methods. In Mule 4, interoperation with Java changes due to the replacement of MEL by DataWeave, a functional language. Since functional languages should not have side effects on their input arguments, it does not make sense for DataWeave to execute random instance methods on random object instances.

== Java Module versus the Scripting Module

The goals of the Java module can be achieved executing Groovy code through the link:scripting-module[Scripting module].

However, the Scripting module does not offer DataSense support.
