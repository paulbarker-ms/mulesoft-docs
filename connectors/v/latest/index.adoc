= Connectors and Modules (for Mule 4)

// TODO: DESCRIPTION WOULD BE NICE :)
Modules are extensions to the Mule runtime that you can use when building a Mule app. Connectors are modules that have a direct connection to an external server, such a database or FTP server. Other extensions, such as the XML and Validation modules do not. You can add these extensions, along with Mule components, to flows in your Mule apps to build connected apps.
