Notes on Mule 4 behavior (for Mule 3 users):

* The examples above use the File connector to read a file in the middle of the flow. The information posted through the `<http:listener>` component is written to each FTP or SFTP site multiple times. Because the component makes use of the link:/mule4-user-guide/v/4.1/streaming-about[repeatable streams feature], you do not need to worry about consuming the stream multiple times.

* The `<foreach>` component automatically goes through each line of the CSV file. In Mule 3, you first needed to transform the CSV file into a Java structure, but because Mule 4 is now Java agnostic, this works out-of-the-box.
