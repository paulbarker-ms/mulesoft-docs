= To Set Up Basic Authentication (Design Center)

This procedure demonstrates how to set up basic authentication. An HTTP user agent uses basic authentication to provide a user name and password when making a request. For example, you send a request to the Github API for user information. The Github API accepts requests for user information on port 443 to https://api.github.com/user.
