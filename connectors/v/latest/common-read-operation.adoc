== Mime Types and Encoding

This connector tries to determine a file’s mime type (`mimeType`) based on its extension. However, when first-hand knowledge of the file’s content is necessary, you can force that `mimeType` to a particular value by using the `outputMimeType` parameter.

The same process works for encoding. By default, the connector assumes that Mule runtime’s default encoding matches the one in the file. However, you can set the encoding through the `outputEncoding` parameter.

== Why Mime Types Matter

DataWeave expressions are embeddable inside operations that generate payloads and other values. Having the correct `mimeType` set helps DataWeave auto-assign types and, in turn, also generate the correct outputs. It also improving the user experience by maximizing the use of DataSense’s functionality.
