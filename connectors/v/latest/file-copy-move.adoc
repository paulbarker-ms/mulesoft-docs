The File connector can copy and move files or directories on demand.

.Example: Copy and Move Operations
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<file:copy sourcePath="source.txt"
  targetPath="backup"
  overwrite="true|false"
  createParentDirectories="true|false"
  renameTo="renamed.txt"/>

<file:move sourcePath="source.txt"
  targetPath="backup"
  overwrite="true|false"
  createParentDirectories="true|false"
  renameTo="renamed.txt"/>
----


Notice the `targetPath` and `renameTo` parameters:

* `targetPath` is the path to the directory into which the file is to be copied or moved. This path must point to a directory.

* `renameTo` is an optional parameter that renames the file as part of the operation. This parameter must be a file name, not a path. If this attribute is not provided, the original file name is retained.
