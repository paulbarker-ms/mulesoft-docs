|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| OAuth Username Password
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| ExpirationPolicy |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration.

If the stream contains more data than can fit in this buffer, the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. Default value is 100 instances.|  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | A numeric increment value by how much the buffer can expand beyond its initial size. To indicate no buffer expansion, set to zero or a negative number. If the buffer is set for no expansion and gets full, any attempts to write to the buffer causes the STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error. Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more memory is used, write attempts causes the STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error. To set no limit, set this value to zero or a negative number. |  |
