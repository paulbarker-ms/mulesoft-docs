== Writing to Existing Files

There are several file write modes you can use when writing content to a file:

* OVERWRITE: If the file exists, overwrite it completely.
* APPEND: If the file exists, write the content at the end of it the existing file.
* CREATE_NEW: Create a new file. If the file already exists, then you will receive an error.

== Locks

This Write operation supports locking in a fashion similar to the Read operation. The main difference is that the lock will be released automatically once the Write operation finishes.
