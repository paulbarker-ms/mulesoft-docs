[[executeQueuedRemoteFunctionCall]]
== Execute BAPI Over qRFC

Executes a BAPIFunction over an Queued Remote Function Call (qRFC).

A queued RFC is an extension of tRFC. It also ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence.
To guarantee that multiple LUWs (Logical Unit of Work/ Transaction) are processed in the order specified by the application.
tRFC can be serialized using queues (inbound and outbound queues). Hence the name queued RFC (qRFC).

qRFC is best used for:

* Extension of the Transactional RFC
* Defined processing sequence

Implementation of qRFC is recommended if you want to guarantee that several transactions are processed in a predefined order.

[[executeSynchronousRemoteFunctionCall]]
== Execute BAPI Over sRFC

Executes a BAPIFunction over a Synchronous Remote Function Call 
(sRFC). A synchronous RFC requires both the systems (client and server) 
to be available at the time of communication or data transfer.
It is the most common type and is required when result is required 
immediately after the execution of sRFC.

sRFC is a means of communication between systems where acknowledgements 
are required. The resources of the Source System wait
at the target system and ensure that they deliver the message/data with 
ACKD. The Data is consistent and reliable for communication.

The issue is if the target system is not available, the source system 
resources wait until target system is available.
This may lead to the Processes of source system to go into Sleep/RFC/CPIC 
Mode at target systems and hence blocks these resources.


sRFC is best used for:

* Communication between systems
* Communication between SAP Web Application Server to SAP GUI

[[executeTransactionalRemoteFunctionCall]]
== Execute BAPI Over tRFC

Executes a BAPIFunction over a Transactional Remote Function Call (tRFC).

A tRFC is a special form of asynchronous Remote Function Call (aRFC). 
Transactional RFC ensures transaction-like handling of processing
steps that were originally autonomous.

tRFC is an asynchronous communication method that executes the called 
function module in the RFC server only once, even if the data is
sent multiple times due to some network issue. The remote system need 
not be available at the time when the RFC client program is executing
a tRFC.

The tRFC component stores the called RFC function, together with the 
corresponding data, in the SAP database under a unique transaction ID
(TID). tRFC is similar to aRFC as it does not wait at the target 
system (Similar to a registered post). If the system is not available, it
writes the Data into aRFC Tables with a transaction ID (SM58) which is 
picked by the scheduler RSARFCSE (which runs for every 60 seconds).

tRFC is best used for:

* Extension of Asynchronous RFC
* For secure communication between systems

[[send]]
== Send IDoc

Sends an IDocument to SAP over an RFC.

An RFC can be one of two types for IDocuments:
* Transactional (tRFC): A tRFC is a special form of asynchronous 
Remote Function Call (aRFC). Transactional RFC ensures transaction-like 
handling of processing steps that were originally autonomous.

tRFC is an asynchronous communication method that executes the called 
function module in the RFC server only once, even if the data is
sent multiple times due to some network issue. The remote system need not 
be available at the time when the RFC client program is executing
a tRFC.

The tRFC component stores the called RFC function, together with the 
corresponding data, in the SAP database under a unique transaction ID
(TID). tRFC is similar to aRFC as it does not wait at the target 
system (Similar to a registered post). If the system is not available, it
writes the Data into aRFC Tables with a transaction ID (SM58) which 
is picked by the scheduler RSARFCSE (which runs for every 60 seconds).

tRFC is best used for:

* Extension of Asynchronous RFC
* For secure communication between systems
* Queued (qRFC): A queued RFC is an extension of tRFC. It also ensures 
that individual steps are processed in sequence.
To guarantee that multiple LUWs (Logical Unit of Work/ Transaction) are 
processed in the order specified by the application.
tRFC can be serialized using queues (inbound and  queues). Hence the name queued RFC (qRFC).


qRFC is best used for:

* Extension of the Transactional RFC

Implementation of qRFC is recommended if you want to guarantee that several 
transactions are processed in a predefined order.
