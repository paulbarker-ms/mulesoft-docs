= IBM CTG Connector Reference

The IBM CICS Transaction Gateway (IBM CTG) connector provides integration with back-end CICS applications using the CICS Transaction Gateway.

== Configuration

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a|  Connection
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| Expiration Policy |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime actually purges the instances when it sees fit. |  |
|===

== Connection Types

[[config_connection]]
=== Connection

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Host a| String |  |  localhost |
| Port a| String |  |  2006 |
| Servers name a| String |  |  |x
| Username a| String |  |  |x
| Password a| String |  |  |x
| Keystore location a| String |  The location of the keystore containing the certificates required for an SSL connection. |  |
| Keystore Password a| String |  The password required to access the keystore for an SSL connection. |  |
| Connection Timeout a| Number |  Sets the socket connection timeout value for a connection to CICS TG. This timeout represents the maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) a managed connection attempts to open a socket connection successfully to a remote gateway daemon. The timeout is ignored for attempted connections to a local gateway instance. A value of 0 represents no timeout. |  0 |
| CTG Trace a| Boolean |  Turns all levels of CTG tracing on or off. |  false |
| Reconnection a| Reconnection |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |

== Types

[[Reconnection]]
=== Reconnection

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Fails Deployment a| Boolean | When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |
| Reconnection Strategy a| * Reconnect
* Reconnect forever | The reconnection strategy to use. |  |
|===

[[reconnect]]
=== Reconnect

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often (in milliseconds) to reconnect. |  |
| Count a| Number | How many reconnection attempts to make. |  |
|===

[[reconnect-forever]]
=== Reconnect Forever

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required

| Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS | A time unit that qualifies the maxIdleTime attribute. |  |
|===

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of memory to allocate to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed. |  |
|===

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed then the connector starts to buffer the content of the disk. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed. |  |
|===

[[CommareaRequest]]
