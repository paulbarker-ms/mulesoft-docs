Anypoint MQ is a multi-tenant, cloud messaging service that enables customers to perform advanced asynchronous messaging scenarios between their applications.

== Default Subscriber Configuration

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<default-subscriber_connection, Connection>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  +++Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform  expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime actually purges the instances when it sees  fit.+++ |  |
| Acknowledgement Mode a| Enumeration, one of:

** IMMEDIATE - An application receives a message and the MQ connector immediately acknowledges and deletes the message. *Note:* In Mule 3, this enum is called NONE - the functionality is the same.
** AUTO - The Anypoint MQ connector automatically sends an Ack or Nack at the end of a flow depending on whether the MQ connector detects a Catch Exception Strategy (ACK) or a Rollback Exception Strategy (NACK).
** MANUAL - An application indicates that it sends its own Ack or Nack using the Anypoint MQ connector local state. |  +++Acknowledgement mode to use for the messages retrieved from the subscribers.+++ |  +++AUTO+++ |
| Acknowledgement Timeout a| Number |  +++Duration that a message is held by a broker waiting for an Acknowledgement or Not Acknowledgement. After that duration elapses, the message is again available to any subscriber.+++ |  +++0+++ |
| Polling Time a| Number |  +++How much time (milliseconds) to be waited if the requested messages are not ready to be consumed.+++ |  +++1000+++ |
| Max Redelivery a| Number |  +++Number of redeliveries to try in case message processing fails. To avoid a poison message, the default value is set to -1 (infinite).+++ |  +++-1+++ |
| Fetch Size a| Number |  +++Number of messages to receive when asking for messages. The response can contain fewer messages than this number depending on the poolingTime set.+++ |  +++10+++ |
| Fetch Timeout a| Number |  +++Maximum duration in milliseconds to wait for the required amount of messages. If this duration elapses, the response is sent with as many messages as received during the period.+++ |  +++1000+++ |

[[PoolingProfile]]
=== Pooling Profile Type

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that may be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted. |  | 
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that may be idle at one time. |  | 
| Max Wait a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the exhaustedAction is set to WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT. |  | 
| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects are evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  | 
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed. |  | 
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL | Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. Possible values are: "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL", which throws a NoSuchElementException, "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT", which will block by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available, or WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW, which creates a new Mule instance and returns it, essentially making maxActive meaningless. If a positive maxWait value is supplied, it blocks for at most that many milliseconds, after which a NoSuchElementException is thrown. If maxThreadWait is a negative value, it blocks indefinitely. |  | 
| Initialisation Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIALISE_NONE
** INITIALISE_ONE
** INITIALISE_ALL a| Determines how components in a pool should be initialized. The possible values are: 

* INITIALISE_NONE - Load any components into the pool on startu.
* INITIALISE_ONE - Load one initial component into the pool on startup.
* INITIALISE_ALL - Load all components in the pool on startup. |  | 
| Disabled a| Boolean | Whether pooling should be disabled |  | 
|===

[[ExpirationPolicy]]
== Expiration Policy Type

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Idle Time a| Number | A scalar time value for the maximum amount of time a dynamic configuration instance should be allowed to be idle before it's considered eligible for expiration. |  | 
| Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS | A time unit that qualifies the maxIdleTime attribute. |  | 
|===

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
== Redelivery Policy Type

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | The maximum number of times a message can be redelivered and processed unsuccessfully before triggering process-failed-message. |  | 
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | Whether to use a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  | 
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | The secure hashing algorithm to use. If not set, the default is SHA-256. |  | 
| Id Expression a| String | Defines one or more expressions to use to determine when a message has been redelivered. This property may only be set if useSecureHash is false. |  | 
| Object Store a| <<ObjectStore>> | The object store where the redelivery counter for each message is going to be stored. |  | 
|===

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
== Repeatable In Memory Stream Type

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of memory to allocate to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | By how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory that will be used. If more than that is used, then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed. |  | 
|===

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
== Repeatable File Store Stream Type

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed, it buffers the content on disk. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed. |  |
