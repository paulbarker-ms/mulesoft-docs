= Java Module Argument Transformation
:keywords: Java, custom code, transformation, arguments

*Available since version 1.1*

The Java Module transforms the arguments given to a Java invocation when they don't exactly
match the type expected by the java method but there is a way to infer how to transform the
given parameter to what the method expects.

== When Will The Arguments Be Transformed?

For every parameter given, the module will check whether its type matches the type
expected by the method for that parameter or not. If it is not what the method expects, the
module will try to transform it to what is expected.

== Simple Example of Argument Transformation

This is a simple example where one of the arguments is transformed:

The static method 'min' from the 'Math' class will be called, it expects
to receive two `int` parameters, the call will be made with a Number and a String

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="calculateMinimum">
  <java:invoke-static class="java.lang.Math" method="min(int,int)" >
    <java:args>#[{
        'arg0': 5,
        'arg1' : "3"
      }]
    </java:args>
  </java:invoke-static>
</flow>
----

In this case 'arg1' would have been passed as a String, but it is transformed into an int
before calling the java method.

== Custom POJO Passed to the Module as a Map

Previously, when working with custom POJOs, the user had to explicitly declare in the DataWeave
expression to what type the data should be transformed. Now, the Java Module automatically
recognizes what is the expected type for a given argument and tries to transform the given
data to the expected type. Here is an example of when a Map parameter is transformed
into a custom POJO by the module.

Here is the class of the POJO:

[source, java, linenums]
----
public class Car {
  private String doors;
  private String wheels;
  private String engine;

  public String getDoors() {
    return doors;
  }

  public String getWheels() {
    return wheels;
  }

  public String getEngine() {
    return engine;
  }
}
----

A Java class declares a static method that receives an instance of the POJO defined above:

[source, java, linenums]
----
public class CarUtils {
  public static String describeCar(Car car) {
    return "This are the car has: " + car.getEngine() + "," + car.getWheels() + "," + car.getDoors();
  }
}
----

Mule flow where said static method is invoked:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="describeCarFlow">
    <java:invoke-static class="CarUtils" method="describeCar(Car)" >
        <java:args>
            #[{
            'car': {
                'doors' : "Four doors",
                'engine' : "120 Horse power engine",
                'wheels' : "17 Inch chromed rims"
            }
            }]
        </java:args>
    </java:invoke-static>
</flow>
----

The mule operation is receiving a Map named car whose key and values can be mapped to a
Car instance. This Map will be transformed into such instance before the invocation of
the java method. Without this improvement the invocation would fail stating that the arguments
passed to the java method did not match its signature.

== Collections And Map

The Module will check that every element of the Collection and every entry of the map honors
the Java Generic declared by the Method Signature. If any element fails this check, the whole
Collection or Map will have to be created and repopulated with the transformed elements.
[WARNING]
The Java method will be called with another instance of the Collection or
Map if a transformation is needed(not the same as the one passed in the Mule flow). This
is particularly important if the method called is expected to add or remove elements in
the Collection or Map and the ability to reference this Collection or Map after the invocation is needed.

== Example Where a List is Transformed

This is an example where the List given to the operation needs to be transformed and
a new List with the transformed items will be passed to the java method.

This is the java class that declares a static method:

[source, java, linenums]
----
public class IntegerUtils {
  public static Integer sumNumbers(List<Integer> numbers) {
    return numbers.stream().mapToInt(i -> i.intValue()).sum();
  }
}
----

This is how it is invoked in a mule flow:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="sumListOfNumbers">
  <java:invoke-static class="IntegerUtils" method="sumNumbers(List)">
    <java:args>
      #[{
        'numbers' : [1, "5", 4, "8", 3]
      }]
    </java:args>
  </java:invoke-static>
</flow>
----

Notice that the list given in the flow has some two String objects which will have
to be transformed to Integer.

== Example Where a Map is Transformed

This is an example where the Map given to the operation needs to be transformed and
a new Map with the transformed keys and values will be passed to the java method.

This is the java class that declares a static method:

[source, java, linenums]
----
public class MapUtils {
  public static Integer sumMapValues(Map<String, Integer> map) {
    return map.keySet().stream().mapToInt(i -> i.intValue()).sum();
  }
}
----

This is how it is invoked in a mule flow:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="sumValuesOnMap">
  <java:invoke-static class="MapUtils" method="sumMapValues(Map)">
    <java:args>
      #[{
        'map' :{
          'books': "22",
          'pencils': 33,
          'pens': 12
        }
      }]
    </java:args>
  </java:invoke-static>
</flow>
----

This Map contains values that does not comply with the generics imposed in the Java
method. Because of this, a new instanced with the transformed key and values will be
used to call the method.
