The Anypoint Connector for Amazon SNS provides connectivity to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) API, enabling you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Mule applications can use the Amazon SNS Connector to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. 

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

To be able to use the Amazon SNS Connector, you must have the following:

* Access to Amazon Web Services - SNS.
* To access AWS with the connector, you need the credentials in the form of IAM.
* Anypoint Studio version 7.0 (or higher) or Anypoint Design Center.

=== Compatibility

Amazon SNS connector is compatible with:

[%header,cols="20a,80a",width=70%]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime |4.0.0
|AWS SDK for Java |1.11.79
|Java |1.8.0_x or higher
|Anypoint Studio |7.0 or higher
|===

[[install]]
== Install the Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

[[config]]
== Configuring the Connector Global Element

To use the Amazon SNS connector in your Mule application, configureÂ a global Amazon SNS element that can be used by all the Amazon SNS connectors in the application.

=== Configuring with Studio Visual Editor

. Click the Global Elements tab at the base of the canvas.
. In the Global Configuration Elements screen, click Create. Following window would be displayed.
+
image:amazon-sns-config-global-wizard.png[Global Element Configuration Wizard]
+
. In the Choose Global Type wizard, expand Connector Configuration and select Amazon SNS Configuration and click Ok. Following window would be displayed.
+
image:amazon-sns-global-config.png[Global Element Properties]
+
In the image above, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the
`src` folder of your project. 
. Configure the parameters according to instructions below.
+
[%header,cols="30a,70a",width=80%]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration to reference it.
|Access Key |Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account.
|Secret Key |Key that plays the role of a password.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain |Checkbox that controls whether temporary credentials should be used.
|Region Endpoint| Set the topic region endpoint.
|Topic Arn |Topic ARN to test the connectivity.
|===
+
You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better reusability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ. 
+
. Keep the Pooling Profile and the Reconnection tabs with their default entries.
. Click Test Connection to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Amazon SNS.
. Click OK to save the global connector configurations.

=== Configuring with XML Editor or Standalone

. Ensure that you have included the Amazon SNS namespaces in your configuration file.

If you or your IAM users forget or lose the secret access key, you can create a new access key. 

== Using This Connector

Amazon SNS connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation for the connector to perform. The connector currently supports the following list of operations:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Operation |Description
| Add Permission | Adds a statement to a topic's access control policy
| Confirm Subscription | The ConfirmSubscription action verifies an endpoint owner's intent to receive messages by validating the token sent to the endpoint by an earlier Subscribe action.
| Create Platform Application | Creates a platform application object for one of the supported push notification services, such as APNS and GCM, to which devices and mobile apps may register.
| Create Platform Endpoint | Creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported push notification services.
| Create Topic | The CreateTopic action creates a topic to which notifications can be published.
| Delete Endpoint | Deletes the endpoint for a device and mobile app from Amazon SNS.

|===

=== Connector Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location.

Namespace: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/sns+`
Schema Location: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/sns/current/mule-sns.xsd+`

If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, paste the namespace and schema into your Configuration XML.

== Use Cases and Demos

Common use cases for the connector:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Use Case |Description
|Sending Amazon SNS messages to Amazon SQS queues |Amazon SNS works closely with Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).By using Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS together, messages can be delivered to applications that require immediate notification of an event, and also persisted in an Amazon SQS queue for other applications to process at a later time.
|Sending Amazon SNS messages to HTTP/HTTPS endpoints |You can use Amazon SNS to send notification messages to one or more HTTP or HTTPS endpoints. When you subscribe an endpoint to a topic, you can publish a notification to the topic and Amazon SNS sends an HTTP POST request delivering the contents of the notification to the subscribed endpoint.
|===

[[example-use-case]]
=== Demo Mule Application Using the Connector

Send messages to Amazon SQS Queue.

When you subscribe an Amazon SQS queue to an Amazon SNS topic, you can publish a message to the topic and Amazon SNS sends an Amazon SQS message to the subscribed queue.

You can subscribe an Amazon SQS queue to an Amazon SNS topic using the AWS Management Console for Amazon SQS, which simplifies the process.
