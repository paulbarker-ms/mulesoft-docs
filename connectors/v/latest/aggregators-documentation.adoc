[[aggregators-reference]]
= Aggregators Module Documentation Reference

An Aggregator is a pass-through router, meaning that the same message that is processed by the aggregator is going to be processed by the components that follow it. The only modifications are the addition of some message attributes that provide information about the aggregation.

== Configurations

There is no configuration for Aggregators because the module is based only on operations. Each different type of aggregator is a different operation that configurable through its parameters.

== Aggregator Types

There are size-based, time-based, and group-based aggregators.

Aggregates elements in different groups according to a group ID.

Every time a new event reaches the aggregator, the ID of the element will be resolved. If a group with that ID already exists in the aggregator, the value will be added to that group. Otherwise, a new group with that ID will be created and the received element will be the first element in that group aggregation.

Some important concepts appear with the group-based aggregator:

* Group timeout: When a group has to be released because all the necessary events of the group did not arrive within the expected time. If a group has timed out but is not yet evicted, it will reject attempts to add any new elements to that group.

* Group eviction: When a group is removed from the aggregator, regardless of whether it was completed or timed out. If a new element with that group's ID is recieved by the aggregator, the group will be created again.

Lastly, because elements that reach group-based aggregators are related to a split sequence when the events have a `sequenceNumber`, they are sorted in increasing order prior to the aggregation release.

==== Parameters

| Content | Expression | The expression that defines what to aggregate. The result of the evaluation is the value stored in the aggregation. | #[message] | {nbsp}
| Group Id | Expression | The expression to be evaluated for every new message received in order to get the ID for the group where it should be aggregated. | #[correlationId] | {nbsp}
| Group Size | Number | The maximum size to assign to the group with the group ID resolved. All messages with the same group ID must have the same group size.

| Timeout | Number |  A maximum time to wait for the aggregation of a group to complete. If the timeout is reached before the total number of elements in that group is equal to the group's size, the aggregation will be considered complete.

== Sources

[[aggregator-listener]]
=== Aggregator Listener

`<aggregators:aggregator-listener aggregatorName="exampleAggregator" includeTimedOutGroups="false">`

Once the aggregator that is referenced by the listener completes an aggregation, the listener will be triggered with a list of all the elements. Though the aggregation listener can be used for any kind of aggregator, it is important for time-driven aggregations. Such aggregations are triggered asynchronously and outside an event context, so they do not execute an aggregator route and can only reach components in flows with an aggregator listener as the source.


==== Parameters

[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Aggregator Name | String | The name of the aggregator to listen to. Once that aggregator releases its elements, the listener will be executed. Each listener can only reference one aggregator, and each aggregator can only be referenced by at most one listener. | {nbsp} | X{nbsp}
| Include Timed Out Groups | Boolean | Indicates whether the listener should be triggered when a group is released due to a timeout. | false | {nbsp}
|======================

== Aggregation Attributes
Each time a message goes through an aggregation, some attributes with information about the aggregation are added to it.

[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description
| Aggregation ID | String | The ID from the group where the element was aggregated. If the aggregation strategy does not aggregate by group, this field will be an autogenerated value that is kept until the aggregation is released (as with group-based and time-based aggregators).
| First Item Arrival Time | Date | The time when the first value was aggregated.
| Last Item Arrival Time | Date | The time when the last value was aggregated.
| Is Group Complete | Boolean | True if the aggregation is complete, False otherwise.
|======================

== Time-Based Versus Event-Driven Aggregations

There are two kinds of triggers for aggregations: synchronous (or event-driven) and asynchronous (or time-driven). As seen in the configurations, an aggregation can be considered complete based on a new value being added to the list (as when a max size is specified) or because some timeout or time period was completed. _This is important because the type of aggregation determines which chain of components to execute with that list of elements._

Each time counter associated with an aggregator starts counting the moment the first message of a group arrives. Once the aggregation is complete, the counter resets and waits for the next element to arrive.

For single-group aggregators (time-based and size-based aggregators), there is only one time counter, but for the group-based aggregator, there is one counter per group.

If an aggregation is released by a time period or timeout completion, it will never execute the routes in its definition. That leads to an unwanted scenario where only a piece of a flow is executed, starting from the processor's chain configured inside the aggregator and continuing with the components that follow it but without executing any from the flow's source to the aggregator itself.

This means that the event must have been created within the aggregator, but that is not desirable. Besides, if you consider the case of an aggregator inside a Try scope where a transaction is started, the transaction context would not be available in the context of the message processors inside the aggregator.

That is why the aggregator listener exists and why the time-based-aggregator does not accept an aggregation-complete-route.

On the other hand, if an aggregation is completed due to a new event being added to the aggregated elements list and reaching a max size, then both the aggregation-complete route and any aggregator listener that is hooked to that aggregator will be executed. That is possible because in order to have reached the aggregator, the message must have gone through every message processor prior to it and we can be sure that the whole flow was executed from it's source forward.

So, if you want aggregation to be completed synchronously, you can either define how to process it in a processor's chain inside the same aggregator (aggregation-complete route) or in another flow with an aggregation listener as it source (or both). Otherwise, if the aggregation will be triggered by a time period completion, the only way it will be processed is with a processor's chain defined in a separate flow and with an aggregator listener as it source.


== Aggregators in a Cluster

The module is developed to work in a cluster out-of-the-box. However, to prevent unexpected behavior, you need to take into account these configuration details:

When a time-driven aggregation is defined and the first event arrives, it is scheduled in the primary node of the cluster. Because new events can arrive in any node of the cluster, you need a way to notify and make the primary node schedule that aggregation.
To do that, another task in the primary node periodically determines whether it is necessary to schedule a new aggregation.
This can lead to a problem if the interval between checks for new aggregation scheduling is much longer than the actual timeout of the aggregation, because the aggregation could be over before it is scheduled, or there might be errors in the time computation.

To avoid this issue, you can configure the frequency at which the primary node checks for new aggregations to be scheduled.
You can define this value using either:

* The global configuration property (in ms) `aggregatorsSchedulingPeriod`
* The system property `-M-Dmule.aggregatorsSchedulingPeriod`


== Object Store Configuration

For any aggregator, an object store can be configured either by referencing a global OS or creating a private one.
