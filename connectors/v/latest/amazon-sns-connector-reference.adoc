The confirmSubscription action verifies an endpoint owner's intent to receive messages by validating the token sent to the endpoint by an earlier Subscribe action. If the token is valid, the action creates a new subscription and returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This call requires an AWS signature only when the AuthenticateOnUnsubscribe flag is set to "true". http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_ConfirmSubscription.html[View this operation in the Amazon API reference].

`<sns:subscribe>`

The Subscribe action prepares to subscribe an endpoint by sending the endpoint a confirmation message. To actually create a subscription, the endpoint owner must call the confirmSubscription action with the token from the confirmation message.

[[unsubscribe]]
== Unsubscribe

`<sns:unsubscribe>`

The Unsubscribe action deletes a subscription. If the subscription requires authentication for deletion, only the owner of the subscription or the its topic's owner can unsubscribe, and an AWS signature is required. If the Unsubscribe call does not require authentication and the requester is not the subscription owner, a final cancellation message is delivered to the endpoint, so that the endpoint owner can easily resubscribe to the topic if the Unsubscribe request was unintended. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Unsubscribe.html[View this operation in the Amazon API reference].

| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | This is the amount of instances that will be initially be allowed to be kept in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then it expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower will mean that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error will be raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory that will be used. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error will be raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
