= RosettaNet Connector Reference

This is the main class of an extension, and is the entry point from which configurations, connection providers, operations, and sources are declared.

[[config]]
== Config

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Global HTTP Listener a| String | Reference to a global HTTP Listener definition for the service endpoint used by a partner for both action and signal messages. |  |x
| Service Endpoint Path a| String | Service endpoint path, appended to the base path in the HTTP Listener. |  |x
| Global HTTP Request a| String |  Reference to a global HTTP Request definition for a partner service endpoint. This is used when sending both action and signal messages. |  |x
| Request Endpoint Path a| String |  Partner endpoint path, appended to the base path in an HTTP Request. |  |x
| Keystore path a| String |  Keystore containing trusted partner certificates and your private signing key and certificate (JKS format). |  |
| Keystore access password a| String |  Keystore access password. |  |
| Signing key password a| String |  Private signing key password (required if signing either action or signal messages). |  |
| Override message signing a| Enumeration, one of:

** ALWAYS
** NEVER |  Forces message signing on or off (when set, overrides signing configured by a PIP definition). |  |
| Global usage code a| Enumeration, one of:

** Test
** Production |  Choose whether operating in Test or Production mode, or if both are allowed. |  Production |
| Object store reference a| ObjectStore |  Object store configuration reference. If not set the connector always uses the default persistent object store to retain sent messages waiting for acknowledgments or retries; if set, the referenced bean must be an object store configuration to be used instead. |  |
| Mule DUNS identifier a| String |  DUNS business identifier for this organization. |  |x
| Mule location identifier a| String |  Location ID for this organization. |  |x
| Partner DUNS identifier a| String |  Expected DUNS business identifier for partner organization. |  |x
| Partner location identifier a| String |  Expected location ID for partner organization. |  |x
| Role in PIP a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIATOR
** RESPONDER |  Our role in PIP usage. |  |x
| PIP definition path a| String |  PIP file path. |  |x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime only purges  instances as needed. |  |

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required

| Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS | A time unit that qualifies the maxIdleTime attribute. |  |

| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | By how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
