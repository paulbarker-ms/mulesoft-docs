** NoAcknowledgement
** AtLeastOnce |  The message delivery mode when receiving messages from the Gateway. |  |
| Expiration Policy a| ExpirationPolicy |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Fails Deployment a| Boolean | When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  | 
| Reconnection Strategy a| * reconnect
* reconnect-forever | The reconnection strategy to use. |  | 
|===

[[reconnect]]
=== Reconnect

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often in milliseconds to reconnect. |  | 
| Count a| Number | How many reconnection attempts to make. |  | 
|===

[[reconnect-forever]]
=== Reconnect Forever

[%header%autowidth.spread]

| Max Idle Time a| Number | A scalar time value for the maximum amount of time to allow a dynamic configuration instance to be idle before being eligible to expire. |  | 
| Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS | A time unit that qualifies the maxIdleTime attribute. |  |

| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | The maximum number of times a message can be redelivered and processed unsuccessfully before triggering process-failed-message. |  | 
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | Whether to use a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  | 
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | The secure hashing algorithm to use. If not set, the default is SHA-256. |  |

|===

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of memory to allocate to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can be fit into this buffer, the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, which means that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error occurs when the buffer is full. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory to use. If more memory is used, a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error occurs. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed. |  | 
|===

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed then it starts to buffer the content on disk. |  |

** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed. |  |
