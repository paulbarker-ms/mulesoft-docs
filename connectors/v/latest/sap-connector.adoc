= SAP Connector

_Premium_

The SAP connector enables the integration of data to and from SAP NetWeaver-based and external systems.

Note: This connector is only available in Studio 7 and not available in the Design Center feature of Anypoint Platform.

This connector requires a separate license. Contact MuleSoft to evaluate or use this connector in production.

Mule runtime supports SAP integration through our Anypoint Connector for SAP, an SAP-certified Java connector that leverages the SAP Java Connector (JCo) libraries, thus allowing Mule applications to:

* Execute BAPI functions over the RFC protocol, supporting the following types:
** Synchronous RFC (sRFC)
** Transactional RFC (tRFC)
** Queued RFC (qRFC)
* Act as a JCo Server to be called as a BAPI over sRFC, tRFC, and qRFC.
* Send IDocs over tRFC and qRFC.
* Receive IDocs over tRFC and qRFC.
* Transform SAP objects (JCo Function/BAPI & IDocs) to and from XML.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, and
Anypoint Studio.

This document also assumes you have:

* A working knowledge of the SAP business context and in particular, the SAP R/3 Business Suite.
* A basic understanding of the SAP NetWeaver Platform from an administration point of view.
* Some fundamental knowledge of the ABAP language.
* Login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility 
information, see the SAP Connector Release Notes.

== What's New in this Connector

This version of the connector drops support for Mule 3.x and adds support for Mule 4.x. Besides this, no functionality was added or removed.

== To Connect in Design Center

This connector version is not supported in Design Center.

== Configure in Studio

To use the SAP connector in your Mule application, configure a global SAP element.

The SAP connector object holds the configuration properties that allow you to connect to the SAP server.

To create a configuration for an SAP connector, complete the following steps:

. Go to Global Elements section, and click Create.
. Select either SAP Inbound or SAP Outbound in the Connector Configuration section
. In the General tab pane, enter the required parameters for defining an SAP connection, which your SAP system administrator should supply.

The SAP Global Element Configuration allows you to define connection properties as well as to easily add the required SAP dependencies to your project.

For ease of use, the SAP connector only shows the most common properties as connector parameters. To configure a property that is not listed in the Properties panel, consult the "Extended Properties" section in this guide.

The minimum required attributes to define are:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Application Server Host| SAP endpoint
|Username | Username of an authorized SAP user.
|Password| Password credential of an authorized SAP user.
|System Number| System number used to connect to the SAP system.
|Client| The SAP client ID (usually a number) used to connect to the SAP system.
|Login Language| The language to use for the SAP connection. For example, EN for English.
|===

As a best practice, use property placeholder syntax to load the credentials in a more simple and reusable way. 

Click the Test button to verify that the connection to the SAP instance succeeded. If the credentials are correct you should receive a Test Connection Successful message.

== To Add Libraries for this Connector

. Go to the connector's Global Configuration.
. Click Add dependency to add each required driver.

If you want to install the dependencies in your local Maven repository, run these commands:

[source, bash]
----
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.sap.conn.idoc -DartifactId=com.sap.conn.idoc.sapidoc3 -Dversion=3.0.18 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=sapidoc3.jar
----

[source, bash]
----
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.sap.conn.jco -DartifactId=com.sap.conn.jco.sapjco3 -Dversion=3.0.18 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=sapjco3-3.0.15.jar
----

This installs the Mac version of libsapjco3:

[source, bash]
----
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.sap.conn.jco -DartifactId=com.sap.conn.jco.libsapjco3 -Dversion=3.0.18 -Dclassifier=external-library -Dpackaging=jnilib -Dfile=libsapjco3.jnilib
----

Make sure you are using the proper version of the SAP JCO libraries. They have to match the operating system and architecture (64bit vs 32bit).

== Extended Properties

To define extended properties for the SAP connector global element, complete the following steps:

. Navigate to the Advanced tab on the General pane.
. Locate the Extended Properties section at the top of the window.
. Select the Edit inline option.
. Click the plus button ('+') to add a new extended property.

For this to work you must set the property name, as defined by SAP, in your configuration. 

=== SAP Inbound

There are no special Advanced properties for this configuration.

=== SAP Outbound

=== SAP JCo Architecture

SAP JCo facilitates communication between an SAP backend system and a Java application. It allows Java programs to connect to SAP systems and invoke Remote Function Modules. It also allows parsing of IDocs (SAP Intermediate Documents), among other object types. Both inbound and outbound communications are supported.

* Java API: handles dynamic metadata lookup and caching. It implements JCO.Function, which is the container for parameters and/or tables for the SAP Function Module (BAPI) in Java. Java apps are built on top of the Java API.

* JNI (Java Native Interface): originally, SAP created libraries in C language to allow direct RFC calls to SAP, to manipulate with data. JCo wraps C libraries in Java to provide platform-native access into the SAP system. RFC Middleware uses RFC Library through (JNI) Layer.

* RFC (Remote Function Call): communication with the SAP system is performed over the RFC protocol. RFC means calling BAPI or triggering IDoc processing that runs in another system as calling program. The RFC interface enables function calls between two SAP systems or between the SAP and external system.

* RFC Library: libraries of C language-based functions to access the SAP system. RFC library is addressed by JNI.

* RFC Layer: SAP component that processes RFC calls.

* SAP Java IDoc Class Library: provides structured, high-level interpretation and navigation of SAP IDocs in Java. It consists of the following add-on packages:
** SAP Java Base IDoc Class Library: a middleware-independent library that provides a set of general base classes and interfaces for middleware dependent Java IDoc Class Library implementations.
** SAP Java Connector IDoc Class Library: a middleware-independent library for creating, sending, and receiving IDocs.

* FM (Function Module): Function modules are procedures that are defined in the ABAP language of SAP. It allows the encapsulation and reuse of global functions in the SAP System.

* BAPI (Business Application Programming Interface): is the Function Module that fulfills certain design criteria, such as:
** Implements a method of a SAP Business Object.
** Maintains a static interface through different versions of the SAP system.
** Is remote-enabled.
** Runs to completion with or without user interaction.
** Handles errors.

* IDoc (Intermediate Document): standard SAP format for electronic data interchange between SAP systems. Different messages types (such as delivery notes or purchase orders) generally correspond to different special formats, known as IDoc types. Multiple message types with related content can, however, be assigned to a single IDoc type.

* ALE (Application Link Enabling): technology for setting up and operating distributed applications. ALE facilitates distributed, yet integrated, installation of SAP systems. This involves business-driven message exchange using consistent data across loosely linked SAP applications. Applications are integrated through synchronous and asynchronous communication, rather than by use of a central database.

* SAP NetWeaver: one of the main technologies and application platforms used by SAP solutions. Its main component is the SAP Web Application Server (WebAS), which provides the runtime environment for SAP applications like ERP, CRM, SCM, PLM, SRM, BI. Other components include enterprise portal, exchange infrastructure, master data management and mobile infrastructure. The SAP NetWeaver is an umbrella term for these technical components.

* SAP NetWeaver runs on both Java and ABAP stacks.

* ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming): this is SAP's proprietary programming language and part of the NetWeaver platform for building business applications.

* The SAP connector uses the RFC protocol to connect to NetWeaver Application Servers (NWAS). 
* http://www.cipherbsc.com/solutions/sap-erp-central-component-erp-ecc/[ECC] and https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_CUSTOMER_RELATIONSHIP_MANAGEMENT[CRM] run on top of NWAS, as other SAP solutions do, and hence any customer using the connector may access those systems.
