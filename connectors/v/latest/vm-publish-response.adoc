In certain cases, you might want to get a response back. The `publish-consume` operation handles this by waiting for the message to be processed on the other end and providing the response. The operation is otherwise exactly the same as `publish`.

Building on the link:/connectors/vm-publish-listen[publish and listen example],  suppose you want to send the response back. You can modify the example like this:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="publish">
  <http:listener path="/json-here" allowedMethods="POST"
    config-ref="httpListener" />
  <vm:publish-consume queueName="#[payload.destination]" config-ref="vm">
    <vm:content>#[payload.body]</vm:content>
  </vm:publish>
  <logger/>
</flow>
----

In the next example, notice that the `<vm:listener>` source embeds a DataWeave expression that builds the response.

Suppose that you want a response in in a predefined JSON format, such as simple one with a `body` and `origin` value:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="listener">
  <vm:listener queueName="queue" config-ref="vm">
    <vm:response>
      <vm:content><![CDATA[#[
                    %dw 2.0
                    output application/json
                    ---
                    {
                    	"origin": "Awesome Mule 4 VM connector",
                      "body" : payload
                    }
                 ]]>
      </vm:content>
    </vm:response>
  </vm:listener>
  <flow-ref name="theIntegrationLogic" />
</flow>
----
