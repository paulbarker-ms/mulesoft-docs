. From the Mule Palette, drag HTTP > Load Static Resource to the flow. 
. Configure the load static resource operation:
* Set the resource base path to the path and file name of the resource. For example, set the path to */Users/max/Sites/index.html*.
* Set the default file to the name of a backup file in the same directory as the resource.
* If you need to use a relative path to the Mule project, use the variable `${app.home}` (for example, `resourceBasePath="${app.home}/images/"`).
+
In the event of a failure, the app loads the backup file.
+
* Accept the other default request settings and save the configuration.
+
. Deploy the app, open a browser, and go to the URL of the Listener. For example: `+http://0.0.0.0:8081/trigger+`.
+
The Listener hears the request on port 8081, and starts the app. The contents of the resource appear in the browser.
