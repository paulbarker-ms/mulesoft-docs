The Anypoint Amazon S3 connector provides connectivity to 
the Amazon S3 API, enabling you to interface with Amazon S3 to store objects, download and use data with other AWS services, and build applications that call for internet storage.

Instant access to the Amazon S3 API enables seamless integrations 
between Amazon S3 and other databases, CMS applications such as 
Drupal, and CRM applications such as Salesforce. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. You can accomplish these tasks using the simple and intuitive web interface of the AWS Management Console.

The AWS SDK for Java provides a Java API for AWS infrastructure services. 
The Amazon S3 connector is built using the SDK for Java. 

== Prerequisites

To use the Amazon S3 connector, you must have the following:

* Access to Amazon Web Services. 
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials.
* Anypoint Studio Enterprise edition.

This document assumes that you are familiar with Amazon S3, Mule, Anypoint Connectors, 
Anypoint Studio, elements in a Mule flow, and global elements.

=== Compatibility

Amazon S3 connector is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|4.0.0 or later
|AWS SDK for Java|1.11.79
|===

== To Install this Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

== To Configure Using the Studio Visual Editor

To use the Amazon S3 connector in your Mule application, configure a global Amazon S3 element that can be used by all the Amazon S3 connectors in your application.

. Click the Global Elements tab at the base of the canvas, then click Create.
. In the Choose Global Type window, expand Connector Configuration, and click Amazon S3 Configuration.
. Click OK.
. Specify the global element properties:
+
image:amazon-s3-01.png[Global Element Properties]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration to reference the connector instance.
|Access Key |Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the AWS account.
|Secret Key |Key that plays the role of a password.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain |Checkbox that controls whether temporary credentials should be used.
|===
+
In the above dialog, values can refer to a configuration file placed in the 
src folder of your project. 
+
You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better reuse of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file.
+
. Keep the Proxy and the Advanced tabs with their default entries.
. Click Test Connection to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Amazon S3. Access to operations on Amazon S3 is controlled through policies for that user. It may not always be possible to validate the credentials before the exact operation for which the user has access is done. This can vary for instance on the bucket name and other parameters. Hence the test connection may fail in case the credentials have a restricted policy such as access to a specific folder within a specific bucket.
. Click OK to save the global connector configurations.

=== To Connect to S3 Compatible Storage

If you need to connect to a different storage than the default AWS S3, you must specify its URL in the S3 Compatible Storage URL field. This field is present in the Advanced tab.

An example of S3 compatible storage is the https://github.com/minio/[Minio Project]. For instance, if you configure it locally you may need to set the S3 Compatible Storage URL to `+http://127.0.0.1:9000+`.

== To Configure Using the XML Editor

. Ensure that you have included the Amazon S3 namespaces in your configuration file.

|===

=== To Specify the Connector Namespace and Schema

In Studio, when you drag a connector from the palette to the Canvas, Studio automatically populates 
the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location. When you manually code the Mule application 
in Studio's XML editor or another text editor, paste the following into the header of your configuration 
XML, inside the `<mule>` tag:

Namespace: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/s3+`
Schema Location: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/s3/current/mule-s3.xsd+`

For example:

[source, xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns:s3="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/s3"
  ...
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/s3 
   http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/s3/current/mule-s3.xsd">
  ...
  <flow name="yourFlow">
  ...
  </flow>
</mule>
----

=== To Reference a Connector in the pom.xml File

The pom.xml is a Maven file that Anypoint Studio generates that contains dependencies for a Mule application.
When you code a Mule application manually, include this XML snippet in your pom.xml file.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mule.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-s3-connector</artifactId>
  <version>5.0.0</version>
  <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----

== To Use this Connector

For the following operations to work, you need to enable or update the subset of the overall list of
Amazon S3 actions in the bucket to specify that the AWS account has access to the subset actions on the bucket.

The Amazon S3 connector supports the following list of operations:

* Abort Multipart Upload
* Complete Multipart Upload
* Copy Object
* Create Bucket
* Create Object
* Create Object Presigned URI
* Delete Bucket
* Delete Bucket Cross Origin Configuration
* Delete Buckt Lifecycle Configuration
* Delete Bucket Policy
* Delete Bucket Tagging Configuration
* Delete Bucket Website Configuration
* Delete Object
* Delete Objects
* Get Bucket ACL
* Get Bucket Cross Origin Configuration
* Get Bucket Lifecycle Configuration
* Get Bucket Location
* Get Bucket Logging Configuration
* Get Bucket Notification Configuration
* Get Bucket Policy
* Get Bucket Tagging Configuration
* Get Bucket Versioning Configuration
* Get Bucket Website Configuration
* Get Object
* Get Object ACL
* Get Object Content
* Get Object Metadata
* Initiate Multipart Upload
* List Buckets
* List Multipart Uploads
* List Next Batch of Objects
* List Next Batch of Versions
* List Objects
* List Parts
* List Versions
* Set Bucket ACL
* Set Bucket Cross Origin Configuration
* Set Bucket Lifecycle Configuration
* Set Bucket Logging Configuration
* Set Bucket Notification Configuration
* Set Bucket Policy
* Set Bucket tagging Configuration
* Set Bucket Versioning Configuration
* Set Bucket Website Configuration
* Set Object ACL
* Set Object Storage Class
* Upload Part
* Upload Part Copy

*Note:* In the Create Object operation, the Content Length must be set to a value greater than zero. If the Content Length is set to zero (0), the Create Object operation creates a zero-byte object.

=== To Use a AWS KMS Master Key

If you need to encrypt objects that you are going to store in S3 buckets using customer managed master keys, specify a Customer Master Key ID in the KMS Master Key field in the Create Object configuration.

=== To Use the AWS Credentials Provider Chain in CloudHub

With the Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain, you can specify the access key and secret in the CloudHub environment:

. Use the following configuration to prepare a Mule app.
+
[source, xml,linenums]
----
 <s3:config name="Amazon_S3_S3_configuration" doc:name="Amazon S3 S3 configuration" doc:id="DOC_ID" >
  <s3:basic-connection accessKey="${aws.accessKeyId}" secretKey="${aws.secretKey}"
  tryDefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain="true"/>
 </s3:config>
----
+
. Export this to get a deployable zip archive.
. Deploy to CloudHub and set the properties aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey through Runtime Manager > Settings > Properties.
. Finish deployment and test. Observe that the access key and secret key are not mentioned 
in the connector configuration and that the correct values are used from the values specified in the settings.   

== Use Cases

The following are common use cases for the Amazon S3 connector:

* Store an image from a URL on Amazon S3, then retrieve and display the image.
* Create an image link in Amazon S3 and update the status in Twitter along with the image link (not shown in this document).

=== Use Case: Store and Retrieve an Image from a URL to Amazon S3

Store an image from a URL in Amazon S3, and retrieve and display the image.
For this example to work in Anypoint Studio, you must provide Amazon Web Services credentials. You can either replace the variables with their values in the code, or you can provide the values for each variable in the src/main/resources/mule-artifact.properties file.
