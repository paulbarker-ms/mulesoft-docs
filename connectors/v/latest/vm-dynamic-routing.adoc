You can use expressions to have a generic flow that sends messages to different queues depending on certain conditions. For instance, you can make link:vm-publish-listen[the publish and listen example] more interesting by also using an expression in the `queueName` attribute.

Suppose that the JSON object that you get through the HTTP connector includes a destination object that maps directly to the name of the queue to which you need to write. You can do the following:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
    <flow name="publish">
        <http:listener path="/json-here" allowedMethods="POST" config-ref="httpListener" />
        <vm:publish queueName="#[payload.destination]">
            <vm:content>#[payload.body]</vm:content>
        </vm:publish>
        <logger/>
    </flow>
----
