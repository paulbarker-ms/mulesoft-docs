= Validation Module

The Validation module can verify that the contents of a message in a Mule flow match a specific criteria. The module provides explicit messages about the cause of an exception in a flow. Based on the specific data you are validating, you can customize the exception message that is displayed in the logs.

If a message does not meet the defined validation criteria, the validation fails and returns a `VALIDATION` error (such as `VALIDATION:INVALID_URL`), which is a  `ValidationException`. By default, this message includes a meaningful message that you can customize.

== Supported Validation Operations

The following types of validation are supported:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

| Is Blank String | Verifies that value is a blank String.

| Is Email | Checks that a given email is valid. The value defaults to the payload.

| Is Empty Collection |  Verifies that value is an empty collection.

| Is False | Verifies that an expression is false.

| Is IP | Checks that a given IP address is valid. It supports both IPV4 and IPV6. In the case of IPV6, both full and collapsed addresses are supported, but addresses containing ports are not.

| Is Not Blank String |  Verifies that value is not a blank String.

| Is Not Empty Collection | Verifies that a value is not an empty collection. The value defaults to the payload.

| Is Not Null | Fails if the value is null or is an instance of `NullPayload`.

| Is Null | Fails if the value is not null and is not an instance of `NullPayload`.

| Is Number | Verifies that a String can be parsed as a number of a specified numeric type.

| Is Time | Verifies that a time is valid for the given pattern and locale. If no pattern is provided, then the locale's default will be used.

| Is True | Verifies that an expression is true.

| Is URL | Validates that a given String can be interpreted as a URL. This is done by invoking the URL(String) constructor in the `java.net.URL` class. If this constructor throws exception, then the validation fails. Any String that this constructor accepts is considered valid.

| Matches Regex | Validates that a given expression matches a Java regular expression.

| Validate Size | Validates that the inputâ€™s size is between given min and max boundaries. It is valid for inputs of type String, Collection, Map, and Array. In the case of a String, the size refers to the length in characters.

| Is Whitelisted IP | Validates that a given IP is in the whitelisted ip list.

| Is Blacklisted IP | Validates that a given IP is not in the blacklisted ip list.

| Is Elapsed Time | Validates that a given time has elapsed some specified time.

| Is Not Elapsed Time | Validates that a given time has not elapsed some specified time.
