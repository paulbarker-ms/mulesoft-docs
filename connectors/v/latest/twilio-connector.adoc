Twilio is a cloud communications infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

This connector provides an API for making and receiving telephone calls, and sending and receiving text messages. To get started with Twilio, follow the steps below to gain access to their free sandbox service to send SMS text-messages. You can configure the Twilio connector in Anypoint Studio with your API credentials.

The Anypoint Connector for Twilio provides connectivity to the Twilio platform, which serves APIs for text messaging, VoIP, and voice calls.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Twilio, Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility
information, see the Connector Release Notes.

To use this connector with Maven, view the pom.xml dependency information in
the Dependency Snippets in Anypoint Exchange.

*Note:* To use the Twilio connector, you must have an active Twilio.com account, either as a Trial or Paid. To create a Twilio account, browse to the Try Twilio web site at the `+https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio+` URL.

== What's New in this Connector

Support for Mule 4 has been added.

== To Create a New Twilio Account

To create a new Twilio account:

. Browse to the Try Twilio web site at the `+https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio+` URL.
. Sign up and click Get Started.
+
With a free developer account, you need to verify your SMS-enabled phone before you can send text messages to it.
+
. When prompted, enter your cell phone number. Follow the instructions provided to validate your number. You receive an automated text message and an authorization code.
. After you enter the authorization code, Twilio takes you to the main screen. 
. Note the Account SID and Auth Token values, and copy the credentials for later use in the Twilio connector configuration menu in Anypoint Studio.
+
Tip: As you copy fields from the Twilio website to the Anypoint Studio connector configuration, be sure to not copy in additional leading and trailing characters or spaces. It is a good idea to visually confirm that your copy and paste functions did not capture surrounding characters.
+
. Click Phone Numbers > Manage Numbers
. Click Get Started.
. Click Get Your First Twilio Phone Number. Twilio lists the number for you. Copy this number for later use.

== Use Case: Studio

In the following example, a Mule application sends a message to a phone number, and then redacts it.

. Create a new Mule application and add the following properties to the mule-app.properties file:
+
[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Property |Description
|accountSid |Your Account SID.
|authToken |Your Authentication Token.
|fromNumber |The phone number from where SMS is to be sent. This is configured inside the Twilio instance.
This is the phone number you received from Twilio.
|===
+
. Add an empty flow and drag an HTTP connector to the inbound part of the flow. Set its path to `/send/{toNumber}`.
. Drag a Transform Message at the flow and prepare the input for the Twilio connector:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
{
    body: "You are now subscribed!",
    from: "${fromNumber}",
    to: "+" ++ inboundProperties.'http.uri.params'.toNumber

}
----
+
. Add a Twilio Connector after the Transform Message and apply the following settings:
** Select the Send Message operation.
** Set Account Sid to `${accountSid}`, and Entity Reference to `#[payload]`.
+
. Drag a Variable component and configure the following parameters:
** Set Name to `messageSid`.
** Set Value to `#[payload.getSid()]`.
+
. Add another Transform Message to create the input for the Redact Message operation:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
{
    body: "",
    from: payload.from,
    to: payload.'to'
}
----
+
. Drag a Twilio Connector after the Transform Message and apply the following settings:
** Select the Redact Message operation.
** Set Account Sid to `${accountSid}`.
** Set Message Sid to `#[messageSid]` (this is the variable we stored two steps above).
** Set Entity Reference to `#[payload]`.
+
. Put Transform Message at the end of the flow.
. Run the application and point your browser to `+http://localhost:8081/send/{toNumber}+`, replacing the `toNumber` with the phone number that you got from Twilio.
