= Microsoft Dynamics 365 For Operations Connector Reference

== Dynamics 365 For Operations Default Configuration

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| * OAuth2
* OAuth Username Password
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| ExpirationPolicy |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges instances as it sees fit. |  |

| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Scope a| String |  |  openid |
| Resource a| String |  |  |x
| Response Type a| String |  |  query |
| Read Timeout a| Number |  Specifies the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the consumer waits for a response before it times out. Default value is 0, which means infinite. |  0 |
| Connection Timeout a| Number |  Specifies the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the consumer attempts to establish a connection before it times out. Default value is 0, which means infinite. |  0 |

| Consumer Key a| String |  The OAuth consumerKey as registered with the service provider |  |x
| Consumer Secret a| String |  The OAuth consumerSecret as registered with the service provider |  |x
| Authorization Url a| String |  The service provider's authorization endpoint URL. |  `+https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/authorize+` |
| Access Token Url a| String |  The service provider's accessToken endpoint URL |  `+https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/token+` |
| Scopes a| String |  The OAuth scopes to be requested during the dance. If not provided, the connector defaults to those in the annotation. |  |

| After a| String |  The name of a flow to execute right after an accessToken has been received. |  |
| Listener Config a| String |  A reference to a `<http:listener-config />` to use to create the listener to catch the access token callback endpoint. |  |x
| Callback Path a| String |  The path of the access token callback endpoint. |  |x
| Authorize Path a| String |  The path of the local HTTP connector that triggers the OAuth dance. |  |x
| External Callback Url a| String |  If the callback endpoint is behind a proxy or should be accessed through a non-direct URL, use this parameter to tell the OAuth provider the URL to use to access the callback. |  |
| Object Store a| String |  A reference to the object store to store each resource owner ID's data. If not specified, the runtime automatically provisions the default one. |  |
