_Premium_

The Anypoint Connector for Siebel lets you access connections between Mule integration applications and the Oracle Siebel customer relationship manager (CRM).

The Siebel Connector has only one option for connecting with Siebel applications, which are categorized by Siebel Objects and Services.

* Oracle Siebel Business Objects: Create, update, upsert, query, and delete Siebel business components.
* Oracle Siebel Integration Objects: Create, update, upsert, query, delete, query page, execute, and synchronize Siebel integration objects.
* Oracle Siebel Business Services: Execute Siebel business services.

All options are available after installing the Siebel connector.

The Siebel connector is built using the Siebel Java Data Beans interface. Java Data Beans provides a native Java interface to access the Siebel Object Manager.

The Siebel Object Manager lets a connector use a generic interface that does not depend on a customized installation. To discover the metadata of Siebel objects in design time, use DataSense in Anypoint Studio. The Siebel connector takes advantage of the Siebel Repository to show a list of available objects as well as their structures in a Siebel custom installation.

The objects can be business components, business objects, integration objects, or business services.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

To use this connector with Maven, view the pom.xml dependency information in 
the Dependency Snippets in Anypoint Exchange.

Because of how closely the connector is coupled with Siebel CRM, this document assumes you have a working knowledge of Siebel Business Components, Business Objects, Business Services, and Integration Objects.

The Siebel connector requires the following two Siebel JAR files: `Siebel.jar` and `SiebelJI_xxx`.

Choose the SiebelJI_xxx.jar based on the locale of the Siebel installation. For instance, if the locale of Siebel installation is US_EN, use `SiebelJI_enu.jar`.
The `Siebel.jar` and `SiebelJI_enu.jar` are available in the `<%SIEBEL_HOME%>\8.1.1.11\Tools_1\CLASSES` folder on the Siebel server.  `%SIEBEL_HOME%` is the installation directory of Siebel.

== What's New in this Connector

The only feature we can mention is the fact that the connector now is a conglomerate of the previous 3 modules (Oracle Siebel Business Objects, Oracle Siebel Integration Objects, Oracle Siebel Business Services)

== To Connect in Design Center

== Connect in Anypoint Studio 7

You can use this connector in Anypoint Studio by first downloading it from Exchange
and configuring it as needed.

=== Install Connector in Studio

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for this connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install this connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, 
which you can click to install the update.

=== Configure in Studio

. Drag and drop the operation you want to execute to the Studio canvas.
. To create a new configuration for the Siebel connector, click the plus button in the Basic Settings area.
+
image:siebel-studio-create-config.png[Studio Create Config]
+
. Fill in the data in the configuration form.
+
image:siebel-studio-config.png[studio-siebel-config]
+
.. For the Required Libraries sections, you have to add the Siebel.jar and SiebelJI_xxx libraries that you previously downloaded.
+
image:siebel-studio-add-jar.png[Add JAR files to Studio]
+
After you click Finish, the library is added as a dependency, but the Global Element Properties window does not change, just in case you want to add more dependencies throughout the Maven Dependency UI.
+
.. For the configuration section, the fields are:
+
** Name - Enter a name for this Configuration to reference it later.
** User - Enter the Siebel username to be used.
** Password - Enter the corresponding Siebel password.
** Server - Enter the server IP address of your Siebel instance.
** Port - Enter the port number. Default value is 2321.
** Server Name - Enter the Siebel Enterprise server name.
** RSA Encryption - Choose if you want to use RSA encryption. Default value is false.
** Object Manager - Enter the value of the Object Manager of your Siebel instance.
** Language - Enter the language corresponding to the locale of the Siebel instance. Default value is ENU.
** Encoding - Enter an encoding type supported by the Siebel server. Default value is utf8.
+
.. The General filters are composed of:
+
** Default View Mode Bus Comp - Enter the default view for DataSense. The default value for this field is 3.
+
Supported values:
+
* 0 (SalesRepView):
+
** Applies access control according to a single position or a sales team.
** Displays records according to one of the following items: The user position or the sales team that includes a user's position. The Visibility field or Visibility MVField of the business component determines the visibility.
* 1 (ManagerView):
+
Displays records that a user and others who report to the user can access. For example, it includes the records that Siebel CRM displays in the My Team's Accounts visibility filter.
* 2 (PersonalView):
+
Displays records that a user can access, as determined by the Visibility Field property of the BusComp view mode object. For example, it includes the records that Siebel CRM displays in the My Accounts visibility filter.
* 3 (AllView):
+
Displays all records that includes a valid owner. For example, it includes the records that Siebel CRM displays in the All Accounts Across Organizations visibility filter.

** Data Sense Filter Query Bus Objects - Use this field to write a query to filter the Business Objects metadata being downloaded into the application.

** DataSense Filter Query Bus Comp - Use this field to write a query to filter the Business Components metadata being downloaded into the application.

** DataSense Filter Query Int Objects - Use this field to write a query to filter the Integration Objects metadata being downloaded into the application.

** Data Sense Filter Query - Use this field to write a query to filter the Business Services metadata being downloaded into the application.

** Other - Use this field to define another query to filter the Business Objects, Services or Integration Objects metadata which is going to be downloaded into the application.

[NOTE]
Limit the number of objects to retrieve through DataSense to a few objects using search specifications, otherwise retrieving metadata slows down Studio.

== Use Case: Studio

The Siebel Connector is an operation-based connector,
which means that when you add the connector to your flow you must specify an operation to perform.

=== Example Use Cases

The following are common use cases for the Siebel v4.0.0 connector:

. Create a Business Component (Action, Account, etc.)

.. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
.. Add a suitable Mule Inbound endpoint, such as the HTTP listener, to begin the flow.
.. Drag the Create business component operation from the Siebel JDB palette onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor.
.. Configure the operation's parameters:
+
image:siebel-studio-create.png[Configure the operation's parameters]
+
.. Drag the Transform Message connector between the HTTP Listener and the Siebel connector on the flow.
.. Configure the input payload with the desired fields:
