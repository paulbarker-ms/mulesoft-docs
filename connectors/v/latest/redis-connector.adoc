Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store.
It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.

The Redis Connector offers complete support for its CRUD API.


== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, 
Anypoint Studio essentials, elements in a Mule flow, and global elements.


== Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location.

If you manually code the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, paste these into the header of your Configuration XML, inside the `<mule>` tag.

[source, xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns:redis="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/redis"
  ...
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/redis http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector/current/mule-redis.xsd">
  ...
  <flow name="yourFlow">
  ...
  </flow>
</mule>
----

== Using the Connector in a Mavenized Mule App

If you are coding a Mavenized Mule application, this XML snippet must be included in your `pom.xml` file.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-redis-connector</artifactId>
  <version>RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
----

Inside the `<version>` tags, put the desired version number, the word `RELEASE` for the latest release, or `SNAPSHOT` for the latest available version.

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime | 4.0.0 or higher
|Redis server | 2.8.x, 3.0.x, and 3.2.x
|===

=== Installing

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

=== Configuring

To use Redis connector in your Mule application, configure a global Redis element that can be used by all the connectors in the application.

The sections that follow provide the properties to configure the global element.

==== Non-Clustered Configuration

image:redis-basic-config.png[Configuration]

In the image above, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the src folder of your project. You can either hardcode your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ. 

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Name | Enter a name for this configuration to reference it later.
|Host| Redis host. Use this field when you want to access you Redis server that is not part of a cluster through the connector.
|Port| Redis port. The port on which your non cluster server is running.
|Connection Timeout| Connection timeout in milliseconds.
|Entry Ttl| The default time to live to be set on keys stored through the connector.
|Password| Redis password. Set this in case that the server requires authentication.
|===

==== Clustered Configuration

image:redis-basic-config-clustered.png[Configuration]

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Name | Enter a name for this configuration to reference it later.
|Cluster Hosts| Redis cluster hosts, separated by comma and with the format host:port. Use this field when you want to access you Redis cluster through the connector.
|Connection Timeout| Connection timeout in milliseconds.
|Entry Ttl| The default time to live to be set on keys stored through the connector.

|===

=== Upgrading from an Older Version

If youâ€™re currently using an older version of the connector, a small popup appears in the bottom right corner of Anypoint Studio with an "Updates Available" message.

. Click the popup and check for available updates. 
. Click the Connector version checkbox and click Next and follow the instructions provided by the user interface. 
. Restart Studio when prompted. 
. After restarting, when creating a flow and using the Object Store Connector, if you have several versions of the connector installed, you may be asked which version you would like to use. Pick one of these.

We recommend that you keep Studio up to date with the connector's latest version. 

== Using This Connector

You can use this connector as an inbound endpoint for consuming messages from a channel. You can subscribe to one of these channels through the connector or as an outbound connector for sending commands to the Redis server.


== Example Use Case

=== Save a value for a key into Redis server

This use case describes how to use the connector for assigning a value to a key into the Redis server.

. Create a new Mule Project by clicking File > New > Mule Project.
. In the new project dialog box, the only thing you are required to enter is a name for your new project. Click Finish.
+
image:redis-new-proj.png[New project dialog]
+
. Navigate through the project's structure and double click `src/main/mule/project-name.xml` to open it. The steps below are all performed on this file.
. Go to the palette and search for HTTP, then drag and drop a new HTTP Connector Listener on canvas. This element is the entry point for the flow and  provides the key and value to be set for that key.
. Go to the palette and search for Redis, then drag and drop a new Redis Set operation after HTTP connector. This element is going to send data to the Redis server.
+
. Double click the Redis Set operation and set its properties as follows:
.. Set Display Name to Set Value For Key Into Redis.
.. Choose from the Extension Configuration drop down Redis__Configuration, which is the default name of a configuration, or any other configuration that you configured.
.. Choose from Operation drop down "Set".
.. Set Key to `#[payload.key]`.
.. Set Value to `#[payload.value]`.
+
image:redis-set-config.png[Redis set operation configuration]
+
. Go to the palette and search for Set Payload, then drag and drop a new Set Payload element after the Redis connector. This element creates the response for the incoming HTTP request.
+
image:redis-set-raw-flow.png[Unconfigured producer flow]
+
. Double click the flow's top margin to open its properties, and change the name of the flow to "set-flow".
+
image:redis-set-flow-config.png[Set flow configuration]
+
. Double click the HTTP Connector [Listener] to open its properties.
.. Click the green plus sign beside the Connector Configuration drop down menu.
.. A pop-up appears, leave the default configurations and click ok.
.. Set Path to `/`.
.. Set Display Name to `Listener`.
+
image:redis-set-http-config.png[Set HTTP configuration]
+
. Double click Set Payload and set its properties as below.
.. Set Display Name to Set Value Response.
.. Set Value to Value Successfully Set.
+
image:redis-set-response-config.png[Set HTTP response configuration]
+
. If you configured Redis global element with placeholder values you must now provide values for these placeholders. Open `/src/main/resources/mule-app.properties` and provide values for following properties: config.host, config.port and config.connectionTimeout
. Deploy the app.
. Once the app is running, send an HTTP request to it to trigger it's flow. To do this, use the CURL command line utility or an HTTP client app (such as Postman) to send a POST request with content-type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and a body in urlencoded format to `+localhost:8081/+`. The request's body should contain a key and a value. For this you can use the following CURL command: 
+
`curl -X POST -d "key=test-key" -d "value=test-value" localhost:8081/`
+
Congratulations! You have just set a value for a key into the redis server.

=== Save a value for a key into Redis server code

. Add the Redis namespace to the Mule element:
+
[source,xml]
----
xmlns:redis="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/redis"
----
+
. Add the location of the Redis schema referred to by the Redis namespace:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/redis 
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/sfdc-composite/current/mule-redis.xsd
----
+
. Add the HTTP namespace to the Mule element:
+
[source,xml]
----
xmlns:http="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http"
----
+
. Add the location of the HTTP schema referred to by the HTTP namespace:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http 
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http/current/mule-http.xsd
----
+
. Add a redis:config element to your project, then configure its attributes:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<redis:config name="Redis__Configuration" host="${config.host}"
 connectionTimeout="${config.connectionTimeout}" port="${config.port}" 
 doc:name="Redis: Configuration"/>
----
+
. Add a `http:listener-config` element to your project, and configure its attributes:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" host="0.0.0.0" 
 port="8081" doc:name="HTTP Listener Configuration"/>
----
+
. Add an empty flow element to your project:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="set-flow">
</flow>
----
+
. Within the flow element, add an `http:listener` element:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/" doc:name="Set value HTTP endpoint"/>
----
+
. Within the flow element, add a `redis:set` after the `http:listener`:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<redis:set config-ref="Redis__Configuration" key="#[payload.key]" value="#[payload.value]" doc:name="Set value for key into Redis"/>
----

. Within the flow element, add a `set-payload` element after `redis:set`:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<set-payload value="Value successfully set" doc:name="Set value response"/>
----
+
. When you're done, the XML file should look like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
