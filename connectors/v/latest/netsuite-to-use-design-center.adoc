== To Connect in Design Center

. In Design Center, click Set Up > Upload, browse for and select the driver for this connector on your file system, and upload it. Alternatively, search for and select a driver that is already uploaded.
. Click a trigger. You can create a global element by selecting this connector as they trigger.
If a global element is not needed, you can use an HTTP Listener or Scheduler trigger.

+
.. Protocol: Protocol selected for the HTTP endpoint, it can be HTTP or HTTPS (secure).
.. Host: IP address where this Mule Application listens requests.
.. Port: Port address where this Mule Application listens requests.
.. Base Path: path where this Mule Application listens requests.
. Select the plus sign to add a component.

[%header,cols="40%,60%"]
|===
|Configuration |Description
|Login Authentication |Makes use of the SuiteTalk's login API call on the first request sent by the connector to establish a session with NetSuite.
|Request Based Authentication |Using this strategy, you can send user credentials in the SOAP header of each request instead of authenticating to NetSuite by invoking login.
|Single Sign-On Authentication |This is a token based authentication system that avoids the use of environment username and password. Here you supply a privateKey together with other information. The connector is then responsible for generating an authentication token and establishing a session with NetSuite via the `ssoLogin` API call on the first request.
|Token Authentication |Similar to Single Sign-On Login Authentication, this is a token based authentication system. However, instead of using a privateKey generated via OpenSSL, this uses a consumer and token key/secret pairs which are established within the NetSuite environment.

. Configure the fields according your selection.

=== Login Authentication

[%header,cols="30%,70%"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration with which to reference later.
|Email |Enter the login email of the NetSuite user interface.
|Password |Enter the corresponding password to log in the NetSuite user interface.
|Account |Enter the account ID of the SuiteTalk NetSuite web services. This is usually found within NetSuite sandbox UI under Setup > Integration > Web Service Preferences.
|Role Id |Enter the role ID for the user in SuiteTalk, which determines the Processor privileges.
|Application Id |Enter the application ID corresponding to the Integration record to be used.
|===

=== Request Based Authentication

[%header,cols="30%,70%"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration with which to reference it later.
|Email |Enter the login email of the NetSuite user interface.
|Password |Enter the corresponding password to log into the NetSuite user interface.
|Account |Enter the account ID of the SuiteTalk NetSuite web services. This is usually found within NetSuite sandbox user interface under Setup > Integration > Web Service Preferences.
|Role Id |Enter the role ID for the user in SuiteTalk, which determines the Processor privileges.

[%header,cols="30%,70%"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration so it can be referenced later.
|Partner Id |Enter the partner ID used in the mapping process.
|Partner Account |Enter the account ID of the SuiteTalk NetSuite web services.
|Company ID |Enter the company ID used in the mapping process for the connector to generate a token.
|User ID |Enter the user ID used in the mapping process for the connector to generate a token.
|Key File |Enter the privateKey file name to pick up from the project. This file should be the DER file generated as per NetSuiteâ€™s specifications. This is used to encrypt the company ID and user ID into a token for ssoLogin.
|Application Id |Enter the application ID corresponding to the Integration record to be used.
|===

=== Token Authentication

|Parameter |Description
|Consumer Key |Enter the consumer key value for the token based authentication enabled integration record being used.
|Consumer Secret |Enter the consumer secret value for the token based authentication enabled integration record being used.
|Token ID |Enter the token ID representing the unique combination of a user and integration generated within the NetSuite environment.
|Token Secret |Enter the respective token secret for the user/integration pair.
|Account |Enter the account ID of the SuiteTalk NetSuite web services. This is usually found within the NetSuite sandbox user interface under Setup > Integration > Web Service Preferences.
