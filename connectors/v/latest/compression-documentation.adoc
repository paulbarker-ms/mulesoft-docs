= Compression Module Documentation Reference

+++
A module which provides functionality for compressing and uncompressing data.
+++


== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Config

+++
Default configuration
+++

==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*{nbsp}
|======================





== Operations

[[unzip]]
=== Unzip
`<compression:unzip>`

+++
Decompresses the given content which is assumed to be in ZIP format. <p> Actual compression will occur in a lazy manner. This operation returns a stream and actual decompression will happen as the stream is consumed. Keep in mind that not all  errors that may rise during compression will occur in this operation. Some might actual appear in the components that consume this stream
+++

==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Content a| Binary |  +++the content to be decompressed+++ |  +++#[payload]+++ | {nbsp}
| Output Mime Type a| String |  +++The mime type of the payload that this operation outputs.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Output Encoding a| String |  +++The encoding of the payload that this operation outputs.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Streaming Strategy a| * <<repeatable-in-memory-stream>>
* <<repeatable-file-store-stream>>
* non-repeatable-stream |  +++Configure if repeatable streams should be used and their behavior+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Target Variable a| String |  +++The name of a variable on which the operation's output will be placed+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Target Value a| String |  +++An expression that will be evaluated against the operation's output and the outcome of that expression will be stored in the target variable+++ |  +++#[payload]+++ | {nbsp}
|======================

==== Output
[cols=".^50%,.^50%"]
|======================
| *Type* a| Binary
|======================


==== Throws
* COMPRESSION:COULD_NOT_DECOMPRESS {nbsp}
* COMPRESSION:INVALID_ZIP {nbsp}


[[zip]]
=== Zip
`<compression:zip>`

+++
Compresses the given content using the ZIP format. <p> Actual compression will occur in a lazy manner. This operation returns a stream and actual compression will happen as the stream is consumed. Keep in mind that any errors that may rise during compression will not occur in this operation, but in those which are consuming the stream returned here.

|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Content a| Binary |  +++the content to be compressed+++ |  +++#[payload]+++ | {nbsp}
| Output Mime Type a| String |  +++The mime type of the payload that this operation outputs.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Output Encoding a| String |  +++The encoding of the payload that this operation outputs.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Streaming Strategy a| * <<repeatable-in-memory-stream>>
* <<repeatable-file-store-stream>>
* non-repeatable-stream |  +++Configure if repeatable streams should be used and their behavior+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Target Variable a| String |  +++The name of a variable on which the operation's output will be placed+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Target Value a| String |  +++An expression that will be evaluated against the operation's output and the outcome of that expression will be stored in the target variable+++ |  +++#[payload]+++ | {nbsp}

== Types
[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | This is the amount of memory that will be allocated in order to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can be fit into this buffer, then it will be expanded by according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much will be buffer size by expanded if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower will mean that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error will be raised when the buffer gets full. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory that will be used. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error will be raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed |  | 
|======================

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed then it will start to buffer the content on disk. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed |  |
