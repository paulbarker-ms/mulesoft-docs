= To Route HTTP Requests to Different Paths

In this procedure, you set up multiple flows, each having an HTTP Listener that listens for requests to different subpaths. The Listeners share a global configuration element (host, port and path). HTTP requests directed to `+http://localhost:8081/account+` are routed to the first flow. HTTP requests directed to `+http://localhost:8081/employee+` are routed to the second flow. When the Listener global element receives a request that doesn’t match the path defined on any of the HTTP Connector Instances, it returns an HTTP 404 (Resource Not Found).

. Create a flow with an HTTP Listener, and set Path to `account`.
. Configure a global element:
* Set Host to *localhost*
* Accept the default Port = *8081*.
. Add a *Logger* component to the flow.
. Create a second flow.
* Drag another HTTP Listener to the blank space below the first flow. 
* Select the same connector configuration element as in the other connector. 
* Set Path = *employee*.
. Add a *Logger* component to the flow.
. In a client browser, go to the first URL: `+http://localhost:8081/account+`.
. In a client browser, go to the second URL: `+http://localhost:8081/employee+`.
. Verify that the logs show the requests routed to the first and then the second flows, respectively.
