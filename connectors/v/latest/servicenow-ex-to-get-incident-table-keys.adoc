This example creates a Mule flow to get keys from the Incident table in a ServiceNow instance. It is a simple configuration that assumes the default HTTP request configuration and sets properties for the HTTP connection: socket properties, proxy settings, and authentication. To employ a different authentication strategy, you can use advanced configuration settings.

. Create a Mule application as a project in Design Center or Studio 7.
. Add and configure HTTP Listener trigger for your flow using a Path such as this one:
+
`/incident/get`
+
You can use the default ServiceNow configuration for the Listener connection.
+
. [Optional] To test your credentials to the ServiceNow server, configure a new HTTP Request component with BASIC Auth along with your username and password.
. Add a Transform (or Transform Message) component after the HTTP component, and set the value to:
. Add a Transform component after the HTTP connector, and provide a transformation script something like this:
+
----
output application/json
---
['description': 'Get Keys Demo']
----
+
Notice that the script transforms the output to JSON from the XML input.
+
. Add the Invoke operation from the ServiceNow connector after the Transform component.
* Set up, test, and save a ServiceNow configuration for the connection to the ServiceNow server.
+
If the connection is unsuccessful, you should correct any invalid connection parameters, and test again.
+
* In the General side-tab, set Service to `incident` and the Operation to `getKeys`, for example:
+
image:servicenow-getkeys-config.png[servicenow-getkeys-config]
+
. Add a Logger to the end of your flow that takes a `payload` (or `#[payload]`) as the message.
. Deploy or Run your app.
. To test the app, navigate to `http://localhost:8081/incident/get`
