= Configure Log Forwarding
:noindex:

This topic describes how to configure Runtime Fabric to forward application and Runtime Fabric cluster logs to an external logging service. The log forwarder provided by Runtime Fabric enables you to send logs to an rsyslog server over TCP or UDP.

== Procedure

. On the Runtime Fabric cluster, create a file named `log-forwarder.yaml`.
. Add the following content to this file:
----
kind: logforwarder
version: v2
metadata:
   name: forwarder1
spec:
   address: 192.168.100.1:514
   protocol: udp
----
+
Using the following values specific to your environment:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Key | Description
|name | Specifies the name of the log forwarding rule.
|address | Specifies the endpoint and port to forward the log data
|protocol (optional) | Specifies the protocol to send the data to. Supported protocols are TCP or UDP.
|===


. Run the following command on the cluster, referencing the file created earlier.
----
gravity resource create log-forwarder.yaml
----

Your logs should now be forwarded to your external logging service.
