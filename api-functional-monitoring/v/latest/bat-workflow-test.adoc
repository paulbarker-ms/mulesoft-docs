= Workflow: Test an API Using API Functional Monitoring

You can test any REST API, such as the Deck of Cards API, which is deployed on a server on the internet. The BAT demo github project, for example, uses the Deck of Cards API.

This workflow covers everything from creation to testing and test reporting of a simplified API. After you create and deploy the API on Anypoint Platform, you can create a simple hello world test suite.
