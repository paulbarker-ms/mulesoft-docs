= To Configure and Write BAT Tests
:imagesdir: ./_images

. Create a directory for the configuration YAML, for example /api-monitoring and a subdirectory for the tests, for example /tests.
. Create a minimal bat.yaml that is the manifest file for testing. For example, the bat.yaml for this procedure lists two test files:
+
----
files:

 - file: ./tests/step.0.dwl
 - file: ./tests/step.1.dwl

suite:
  name: "hello world test suite"
----
+
. Save the bat.yaml at the top level of your testing directory /api-monitoring.
. Create a test file. For example:
+
----
// Functional test for http://apimon.cloudhub.io

import * from bat::BDD
import * from bat::Assertions
---
describe `api-mon` in [

  // First, get a list of users
  GET `http://apimon.cloudhub.io/users` with {

  } assert [
    $.response.status mustEqual 200
  ]

]
----
+
The GET function specifies the URL of the deployed proxy you created earlier in the workflow. For example, on CloudHub, you obtain the URL from API Manager:
+
image::bat-api-mgr-proxy-url.png[]
+
. Save the test file in the /api-monitoring/tests subdirectory as step.0.dwl.
. Create another test file and save it as step.1.dwl.
+
----
// Functional test for http://apimon.cloudhub.io

import * from bat::BDD
import * from bat::Assertions
---
describe `api-mon` in [
  it `assert that there are 10 users` in [
    GET `http://apimon.cloudhub.io/users` with {} assert [
      $.response.status mustEqual 200, //< ---- ASSERTION
      $.response.mime mustEqual "application/json", //< ---- ASSERTION
      log($.response.body match{case list is Array -> sizeOf(list) mustEqual 10
        else -> false}) // < ---- ASSERTION
    ]
  ]
]
----
+
This test asserts that 10 is the size of the users list array returned by the API.
