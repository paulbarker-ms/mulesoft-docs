= BAT CLI Reference

The BAT command line interface lets you run tests locally and schedule monitors for continuous API testing. You can schedule tests in the cloud using the CLI-xAPI.  The BAT CLI is integrated with Anypoint Platform.

This reference covers the syntax and key options you can use with the *bat* command. Using the *bat* command, you can debug and run tests, get credentials for scheduling tests, schedule tests, list test schedules, and perform additional operations.

== bat Command

The *bat* command provides an API functional monitoring command line interface.

=== Syntax

`bat [<file> ... | <option> ...]`

`bat [login --username=<value> [--profile=<value>] --host=<value>]`

This option displays an interactive command for the password.

`password for user [username]: <password>`

Optionally, you can include the option `--password=<password>` in the login command.

Where:

* file is the relative path to the path and file name. The file must have one of the following base names and one of the following extensions:
+
** base file names: main, bat
** extensions: .yaml, or .yml
+
When you execute bat without any arguments, BAT reads the YAML in the current directory and runs the specified tests.
You can create a `config` folder and add different configuration files in `config` for the environments.

== Command Line Options

* `bat ~/path/to/folder/` +
Executes the desired folder. BAT searches for and executes the `bat.yaml` and `main.dwl` files.
* `bat ./folder/file.dwl` +
Executes the desired file. The root of the project is the current folder.
The root of the project is used to resolve imports, and load libraries and files.
** `--config=<name>`
+
Selects a configuration file (from the `config` folder) and registers the result as a global variable.
+
** `--version`
+
Prints to standard output the version numbers of installed BAT and wrapper. If the latest version is not installed, that version is downloaded.
+
** `--bat-version=1.0.51`
+
Executes BAT using the specified version.
+
** `--update`
+
Installs the latest BAT CLI.
+
** `--validate`
+
Validates the file or folder. Also works with `--config` to validate specific configurations.
+
** `get_token`
+
Returns the token for accessing Anypoint Platform in the credentials file. Requires that you first run `bat login` to generate a profile.
+
** `worker register`
+
Generates a post with the machine name and create a dummy target.
+
** `target ls list`
+
Lists all the targets information from the profile's organization.
+
** `schedule create [--cron="<expression>"]`
+
Create a scheduler using a cron expression and generating a zip that includes the tests and all the files. By default, if a cron expression is not entered, tests are scheduled to run every 15 minutes.
+
** `schedule disable <scheduleID>`
Disables the schedule that is identified by the specified ID. If you run `bat schedule ls` after you run this command, you will see that the value
+
** `schedule enable <scheduleID>`
+
Enables the schedule that is identified by the specified ID. Use this command only when you want to enable a schedule that you have disabled with the `bat schedule disable <scheduleID>` command.
+
** `schedule endpoint <arbitrary-URL> [--cron="<cron>"] [--name=<suiteName>] [--target=<targetId>] [--new-relic-license-key=<newRelicLicenseKey>] [--slack-webhook=<slackWebHook>] [--sumo-endpoint=<sumoEndpoint>] [--pager-duty-routing-key=<pagerDutyRoutingKey>] [--custom-report-url=<customReportUrl>] [--custom-report-headers=<header1,header2,...,headerN>] [--custom-report-transformation=<pathToDwlFile>][--init-folder]`
+
Create a monitor in Exchange of using an arbitrary URL, for example `+http://example.com+`. Optionally, you can add commands to generate the bat.yaml with different parameters.
+
*** `[--cron="<cron>"]` By default, tests are scheduled to run every 15 minutes. You can change with the cron expression
+
+
*** `[--name="<suiteName>"]` To set the name of the suite
+
+
*** `[--target="<targetId>"]` Set a specific target to the monitor
+
+
*** `[--new-relic-license-key="<newRelicLicenseKey>"]` Add the new relic report to the bat.yaml.

+
+
*** `[--init-folder]` Store generated exchange.json, bat.yaml and main.dml in the current directory.
+
** `schedule ls | list`
+
List all the schedulers information from the profile's organization.
+
** `schedule rm | remove <scheduleId>`
+
Deletes a schedule by its ID.

Stores the files, exchange.json and main.dwl, generated by creating the monitor in the current directory. Optional.

== BAT Command Examples

* Run multiple test files from the bat.yaml file.
+
`bat bat.yaml`
+
* Run a single file.
+
`bat ./test/myFile.dwl`
* Determine the installed version.
+
`bat --version`
