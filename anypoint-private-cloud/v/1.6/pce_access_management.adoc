= To Configure Access Management in Anypoint Private Cloud

== Overview

This section describes the Access Management features available in Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

Users running Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition can:

. Configure link:/access-management/external-identity#user-management[User Mangement] using link:/access-management/external-identity#configure-ldap[LDAP].
. Configure an <<SMTP,SMTP server>> to send API Manager alerts from your Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition installation
. Set your <<Security,certificates and private key>> to handle SSL encryption for Anypotnt Platform
. Add customized <<Disclaimer,disclaimer>> to the Anypoint Platform Log-in message

== SMTP

The Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition requires that you set up your own SMTP email server to deliver email alerts for both *API Manager* and *Runtime manager*. The SMTP section on the Access Management menu lets you reference the server that you set up.

[NOTE]
--
This service does not create an SMTP server for you. It is intended to configure with the settings of an existing SMTP server within your environment

In the left navigation bar, click the *SMTP* option and configure the details for your SMTP server:

== Security

You can configure Anypoint Platform to use your own certificate. Additionally, you can choose the cipher and DH groups for the key exchange method, if required.

. From Anypoint Platform, select Access Management.
. In the left navigation bar, click Security.
. In the Certificate field, click  Browse and locate the certificate on your local system.
. In the Key field, click Browse button and locate the private key for your certificate.
. Click the Save.
. Optionally, you can upload your own cipher and Diffie-Hellman group file.
+
This provides additional security for Anypoint Platform. However, this step is optional. In most environments you do not need to use this setting.


.. Deselect *Use default ciphers and DH Group*.
.. Enter a set of ciphers from the list of valid nginx ciphers. If you are using Open SSL, you can view this list by running the `openssl ciphers` command. For example, the cipher you enter should look similar to the following:
+
ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384

.. Generate `dhparam.pem` (the Diffie-Hellman group file) using the following `openssl` command:
+
----
openssl dhparam 2048 -out dhparam.pem
----

.. Upload the `dhparam.pem` file from your system.


== Disclaimer

By clicking the *Disclaimer* section you can set up a disclaimer message that your users see when they access the Anypoint Platform's log-in page.
