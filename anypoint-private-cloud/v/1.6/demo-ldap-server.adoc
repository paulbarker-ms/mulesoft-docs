= About the Demo LDAP Server
:keywords:ldap, on-prem, on premises, external identity

This topic describes how to use the demo LDAP server provided by Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition. When installing a single-node configuration, the installer automatically installs a demo LDAP server and configures the platform to use this server for identity management. 

After the installer finishes, log into your Anypoint Platform installation with credentials of the test users in the LDAP repository.


== Default Data in the LDAP Server

During installation, the demo LDAP server is populated with users and groups for demo purposes. You can add your additional users and groups. The server is populated with two groups, each of which is mapped to a Business Group on the platform:

* Marketing
* Sales

The server is also populated with multiple users, each with different roles within different business groups.

**Note:** Each of these users are created with the default password as `Mule1234!`.

== Accessing the LDAP Server

To edit the default data in the LDAP server, you can access it as an administrator at the following URL:

----
http://<public_ip_of_your_installation>:31200/
----

Using these credentials:

** DIN: `cn=admin,dc=mulesoft,dc=local`
** Password: `Password1`

== Testing the Installation

After the installation is complete, sign on to Anypoint Platform as one the test users described above.

. Open a browser and login into the Anypoint Platform using the *MarketingAdmin* user.

. Since the MarketingAdmin LDAP group is configured in this test organization as having the link:/access-management/roles[Roles] `Exchange administrator` and `Application Admin (Production)`. You can also verify that the logged in user actually is an exchange administrator by carrying out tasks in Anypoint Exchange. The same applies for the Application Admin role, which should let you deploy and manage applications on link:/runtime-manager/index[Runtime Manager].

. Log out, and log back in as the *SalesAdmin* user. Only the *Sales* user appears in the user's business groups.
