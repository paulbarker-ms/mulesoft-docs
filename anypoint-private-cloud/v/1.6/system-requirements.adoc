= About Minimum System Requirements

To ensure the performance and stability of Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, your environment must meet the minimum system requirements described in this topic. Before installing or upgrading, review each of following sections and ensure that your environment meets these requirements.

[WARNING]
If your system does not meet all of the minimum system requirements, you cannot install Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

== Supported Viritualization Environments

Only VMWare bare metal virtualization environments and physical servers are supported.

== Software Requirements

The following sections list the software required to install and run the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

=== Supported Linux Distributions

The following Linux distributions are supported:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), versions 7.2.x and 7.3.x
* CentOS, versions 7.2.x and 7.3.x

=== SELinux

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition supports the default SELinux profile running in strict mode. If your environment uses a custom profile, it must provide an unconstrained user context when running the installer. Review any custom profiles with your customer support representative.

== Hardware Requirements

The following sections describe the minimum disk sizes and performance requirements of Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition. During installation, the installer tests to ensure that you have enough enough disk space and performance.

=== Memory and CPU Requirements

=== Disk Size and Performance Requirements

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition has strict minimum size and performance requirements for storage devices used by the platform. All disk drives must meet the following criteria:

* Must have at least 300 MB/sec of throughput. 
* Must have high performance capability, even if they are virtual block devices or network attached storage.

For production usage, each node in your configuration must have the following devices and they must meet the stated minimum requirements. 

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Component |Requirement |Recommended IOPS |Description
|HDD 1 (operating system) |50GB |500 |
|HDD 2 (system data) | 100GB |1500 |Stores system configuration and metadata, including databases and packages. As package sizes can be arbitrary large, it is important to estimate the minimum size requirements and allocate enough space as a dedicated device before installation.
|HDD 3 (application data)| 250GB |1500 |Stores application configuration and data. The amount of space required should be at leasat 250GB, but might vary depending on your specific use case. It is important to estimate the minimum size requirements and allocate enough space as a dedicated device ahead of time.
|HDD 4 (Docker) | 100GB |3000 |Used by Docker’s Device Mapper storage driver. This device must be a dedicated device. It must exist on every node of your cluster.
|HDD 5 (etcd) | 20GB |3000 |Provides dedicated storage for the distributed database used for cluster coordination. This device must be a dedicated device. It must exist on every node of your cluster.
|/tmp (installer) | 20GB |N/A |
|Networking (connectivity between hosts)  |1GbE | |

== Network Requirements

The following sections describe the network requirements for running Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

=== Load Balancer

You must purchase, install, and configure an external load balancer before installing Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

=== Static IPs

All servers in the cluster should have static private IPv4 assigned to them, these must persist after server restarts. If IP addresses are not persistent between reboots, the cluster may enter a failed state.

=== VXLAN

The version of Kubernetes supported by Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition uses an overlay VXLAN and UDP transport to encapsulate traffic. There is direct communication between components of the cluster via TCP. The table below shows the ports used for inter-host communication. You must ensure that all of these ports are configured correctly.

|===
|Protocol |Port/Range |Purpose
|TCP | 2379, 2380, 4001, 7001 | etcd distributed database
|TCP | 4242 | Installer
|TCP | 6060 | Health check
|TCP | 6443 | Kubernetes API server
|TCP | 7373 | Serf RPC agent
|TCP | 8080 | Kubernetes API server
|TCP | 10248, 10249, 10250, 10255 | Kubernetes Kubelet
|TCP | 5000 | Docker registry
|TCP | 3008-3010, 3022-3025, 3080, 7496, 7575| Cluster control plane
|TCP | 7000, 7011, 7199, 9042, 9160 | Cassandra
|TCP | 18080, 18443 | Object store cluster
|TCP | 5431-5435, 5973 | Database cluster
|TCP | 30000-32767 | Internal services port range
|TCP | 61008-61010 | Installer port ranges (only used during install)
|TCP | 61022-61024 | Installer port ranges (only used during install)
|UDP | 8472 | Overlay VXLAN network
|===

=== IPV4 Requirements

To run the platform, the IPV4 forwarding flag must be set to true. You must ensure that there are no processes on your system that set this flag to false. If the IPV4 flag is set to false, the platform fails.

=== NAT Traffic Requirements

In some situation, the Kubernetes overlay network uses NAT. NAT requires that servers be able to send and receive packages with a source and destination that is different from server’s internal IP.

=== SSL Certificate Requirements

In order to use the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, you must provide SSL credentials. You can upload a certificate through the Anypoint Platform UI. This certificate must be trusted by every machine that is connected to the platform.

[WARNING]
You must register the same SSL certificate on every server containing Mule Runtimes managed by your installation.

=== SMTP Server Requirements

Your network must include an SMTP server to manage e-mail alerts that are triggered by the platform.
