= To Manage Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition Using Ops Center
:keywords:anypoint platform, on premises

This topic describes how to use the Ops Center to manage and monitor the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition. The Ops Center is a web-base management too that enables you to perform the following types of tasks:

* Add and remove servers
* View logs and configure log forwarding
* Monitor system stability and performance

== Accessing Ops Center

. Go to the following URL:
+
----
https://{platform-host}:9500
----

. Enter email and password of the admin user that you created during installation.


== Adding Additional Servers

Adding servers enables you to scale up your cluster, even after the installation is complete.

. Login to Ops Center.

. Click the Servers tab, then click the Add Existing button.

. Select the type of node you want to add. 
+
The nodes available depend on the number of nodes in your installation.

. Click Continue.
+
Ops Center displays a command similar to the following:
+
----
curl -s --tlsv1.2 --insecure "https://172.31.48.9:3009/t/8402020736a8a04dda29bc81dfcd5211/node" | sudo bash
----
+

. Run this command on the machine where you are installing the new server.
+
	* You must run this command from an account that has root access.
	* You can only perform this installation on one server at a time.
+
After performing this command, the server is displayed in a list in Ops Center. 

. If necessary, specify the IP address and devices.

. Select the server, then click Start Installation to begin installation of the new server.

== Removing a Server

You can remove individual servers from the cluster where the platform is installed. 

[WARNING]
Deleting a server also removes any applications that are deployed on the server.

. Login to Ops Center.
. Click the Servers tab
. Click the IP address of the server you want to delete, then select Delete.
. Confirm that you want to delete the server.

== Configuring Log Forwarding

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition enables you to forward server-level log data. Log forwarding is designed to forward your logs to a local 3rd party log solution. Forwarding log data to a cloud-based service, like Splunk Cloud, is not supported.

Anypoint Platform uses `rsyslog` to handle logging. To forward these logs to remote hosts perform following:

. Login to Ops Center.

. In the upper right-hand corner, click the admin user name.
+

. Choose Settings, then click the Logs tab.

. Select the protocol you want to use.

. Enter the Destination IP address and port, then click Add.

== Monitoring Stability and Performance

The Ops Center enables you to view data about the stability and performance of the platform.

Metrics dashboards are available for the these application components:

* Anypoint Services
* Cluster
* Object Store
* Pods
* PostgreSQL
* Redis

High-resolution metrics are stored for a default period of 30 days. Other metrics are retained from a period of 6 months up to 5 years.

=== Viewing Metrics

. Login to Ops Center.
. Click the Monitoring tab.
+
By default, Ops Center displays the Cluster dashboard.

When viewing a dashboards, you can navigate through it by selecting from a series of dropdown menus at the top of the section. The options available depend on the selected dashboard. For example, in the *Pods* dashboard you can select a `namespace` and a `podname`.


=== Changing the time scale displayed in the charts

To change the time scale displayed in the charts:

. Click the currently selected time scale on the top-right.
+
. Select a quick option or provide start and end dates.


=== Anypoint Services Dashboard

The *Anypoint Services* dashboard displays metrics for the different sub-components of the platform, including exchange, API notebooks, or the home page. You can filter data by a specific microservice.

This dashboard displays the following metrics:

* Processor
* Memory
* Network
* Filesystem

Each of these metrics are displayed by service.

=== Cluster Information Dashboard

This dashboard shows metrics for the various nodes that make up your platform cluster. You can filter data by `nodename`.

This dashboard displays the following metrics:

* Overall CPU Usage
* CPU Usage by Node
* Individual CPU Usage
* Memory Usage Usage by Node
* Individual Memory Usage
* Overall Cluster Network Usage
* Network Usage by Node
* Individual Node Network Usage
* Overall Cluster Filesystem Usage
* Filesystem Usage by Node
* Individual Node Filesystem Usage

These metrics have different scopes, depending on the context:

* Overall metrics show an aggregate number for the entire set of nodes.
* Metrics that are _by node_ display each node as a separate curve on the same chart.
* Individual node metrics only display it for the node that you selected in the *nodename* dropdown at the top of the section.


=== Object Store Dashboard

The *Object Store* dashboard displays data about the different nodes that make up the object store. It includes the following metrics:

* Node Status
* Read/Write Requests (in requests per second)
* Read/Write Latency
* Active Connections
* Unavailable Exceptions
* Disk Space Used

Metrics that deal with Read/Write values display read and write values as separate curves.

=== Pod Dashboard

The *Pod* dashboard displays data for the individual docker containers running different services of the platform. You can filter data by `namespace` or `podname`.

This dashboard displays the following metrics:

* Individual CPU Usage
* Individual Memory Usage
* Individual Network Usage
* File system Usage

All these metrics are displayed for the selected `namespace` and `podname`.


=== PostgreSQL Dashboard

The *PostgreSQL* dashboard displays data for the PostgreSQL server included in the platform. It displays the following metrics:

* Activity per type
* Cache Hit Ratio
* Active Connections
* Buffers
* Conflicts/Deadlocks
* PostrgreSQL Containers CPU Usage per Pod

Activity per type displays different curves for rows fetched, returned, inserted, updated and deleted, at the level of time granularity that you choose.


== Downloading Data

To download the data displayed in this section as a JSON:

. Click the gear icon at the top of the Ops Center.
. Click *Export*
