= To Manage Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition Using Ops Center
:keywords:anypoint platform, on premises

[WARNING]
This product was previously named Anypoint Platform On-Premises Edition. Beginning with the 1.5.1 release, it is named Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

This topic describes how to use the Ops Center to manage and monitor the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition. The Ops Center is a web-base management too that enables you to perform the following:

* Add and remove servers
* Configure log forwarding
* Monitor system stability and performance

== To Access the Ops Center

The Ops center is reached through port `9500`, so in a browser you can type `{platform-host}:9500`

You must then log in using the email and password of the *admin* user that you set up in the final screen of the installation wizard


== To Add Additional Servers

You can add more servers to your platform installation to scale up your cluster, even after the installation is complete.

. Go to the *Servers* tab
+

. Click the *Add Existing* Button
+
image:installing-anypoint-on-premises-e2892.png[]
. Select the only option: General Purpose Node and then hit *Continue*
. This will give you a command that you must paste on a console on this new server
+
----
curl -s --tlsv1.2 --insecure "https://172.31.48.9:3009/t/8402020736a8a04dda29bc81dfcd5211/node" | sudo bash
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Note that you must run this command from an account that has root access.
Also note that you can perform this installation on only one server at a time.
====

. Once you do, your server should show up as listed on the UI. As in the original installation steps, your server has a set of fields to configure: an IP address and two devices to reference. For your devices, you can either leave the default references, or you can set up your own, see link:/anypoint-private-cloud/v/1.5/prereq-workflow#device-requirements[Device Requirements] for details.

. Select your server and then click *Start Installation* to begin the installation on this new server.

== To Remove Servers


You can easily remove individual servers from the cluster in which you installed your platform.

. Go to the *Servers* tab

== Configuring Log Forwarding

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition enables you to forward server-level log data. Log forwarding is designed to forward your logs to a local 3rd party log solution. Forwarding log data to a cloud-based service, like Splunk Cloud, is not supported.

Anypoint Platform uses `rsyslog` to handle logging. To forward these logs to remote hosts perform following:

. Login to Ops Center.

. In the upper right-hand corner, click the admin user name.
+
image:ops_center_settings.png[]

. Choose Settings, then click the Logs tab.

. Select the protocol you want to use.

. Enter the Destination IP address and port, then click Add.

== To Monitor Stability and Performance

The Ops Center includes a *Monitoring* tab, where you can view data about the stability and performance of the platform. Note that this is not log data about the applications that you run on it, but about the platform itself.

[TIP]
High-resolution metrics are stored for a default period of 30 days. Other metrics are retained from a period of 6 months up to 5 years.

=== To View Metrics


To change the time scale displayed in the charts:

1. Click the currently selected time scale on the top-right.
1. Select a quick option or provide start and end dates.

Metrics dashboards are available for the these application components:

* Anypoint Services
* Cluster
* Object Store
* Pods
* PostgreSQL


When viewing a dashboards, you can navigate through it by selecting from a series of dropdown menus at the top of the section. The options available depend on the selected dashboard. For example, in the *Pods* dashboard you can select a `namespace` and a `podname`.

=== To View Anypoint Services

The *Anypoint Services* dashboard displays metrics for the different sub-components of the platform, including exchange, API notebooks, or the home page. You can filter data by a specific microservice.

This dashboard displays the following metrics:

* Processor
* Memory
* Network
* Filesystem

Each of these metrics are displayed by service.

=== To View Cluster Information

This dashboard shows metrics for the various nodes that make up your platform cluster. You can filter data by `nodename`.

This dashboard displays the following metrics:

* Overall CPU Usage
* CPU Usage by Node
* Individual CPU Usage
* Memory Usage Usage by Node
* Individual Memory Usage
* Overall Cluster Network Usage
* Network Usage by Node
* Individual Node Network Usage
* Overall Cluster Filesystem Usage
* Filesystem Usage by Node
* Individual Node Filesystem Usage

These metrics have different scopes, depending on the context:

* Overall metrics show an aggregate number for the entire set of nodes.
* Metrics that are _by node_ display each node as a separate curve on the same chart.
* Individual node metrics only display it for the node that you selected in the *nodename* dropdown at the top of the section.


=== To View Information about the Object Store

The *Object Store* dashboard displays data about the different nodes that make up the object store. It includes the following metrics:

* Node Status
* Read/Write Requests (in requests per second)
* Read/Write Latency
* Active Connections
* Unavailable Exceptions
* Disk Space Used

Metrics that deal with Read/Write values display read and write values as separate curves.

=== To View Pod Information

The *Pod* dashboard displays data for the individual docker containers running different services of the platform. You can filter data by `namespace` or `podname`.

This dashboard displays the following metrics:

* Individual CPU Usage
* Individual Memory Usage
* Individual Network Usage
* File system Usage

All these metrics are displayed for the selected `namespace` and `podname`.


=== To View PostgreSQL Information

The *PostgreSQL* dashboard displays data for the PostgreSQL server included in the platform. It displays the following metrics:

* Activity per type
* Cache Hit Ratio
* Active Connections
* Buffers
* Conflicts/Deadlocks
* PostrgreSQL Containers CPU Usage per Pod

Activity per type displays different curves for rows fetched, returned, inserted, updated and deleted, at the level of time granularity that you choose.
