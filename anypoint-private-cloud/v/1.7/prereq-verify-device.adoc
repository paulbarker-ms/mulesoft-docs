= To Verify Anypoint Private Cloud Device Requirements

For the platform’s configuration you must assign four dedicated devices for use. One as a system state directory, one holds application data, another holds cluster information and the final device is used as a target for Docker devicemapper configuration.

== Anypoint system data device

The main purpose of the system state directory is to store system configuration and metadata - for example, database and packages among other things. As package sizes can be arbitrary large, it is important to estimate the minimum size requirements and allocate enough space as a dedicated device ahead of time.

This device will be formatted either as `xfs` or `ext4` and mounted as `/var/lib/gravity`. You can use the following shell snippet to guide this process (be sure to specify the correct device name in 2 places).

The following is provided only as an example, and should not be used as-is in production. Formatting and mounting disks is something that should be done by your system administrator. The end result of this is mounting the Anypoint system data device to the path `/var/lib/gravity`. This can be achieved using systemd mount files as shown in the example below, or `/etc/fstab`, or some other method. Please consult with your system administrator to determine the best way to meet this requirement

----
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/<device name>
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/gravity
echo -e "[Mount]\nWhat=/dev/<device name>\nWhere=/var/lib/gravity\nType=ext4\n[Install]\nWantedBy=local-fs.target" | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/var-lib-gravity.mount
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable var-lib-gravity.mount
sudo systemctl start var-lib-gravity.mount
----

== etcd device

The main purpose of the etcd device is to provide dedicated storage for a distributed database used for cluster coordination. It does not require much space, 20GB should be enough.

This device will be formatted either as `xfs` or `ext4` and mounted as `/var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd`. You can use the following shell snippet to guide this process (be sure to specify the correct device name in 2 places).

The following is provided only as an example, and should not be used as-is in production. Formatting and mounting disks is something that should be done by your system administrator. The end result of this is mounting the Etcd device to the path `/var/lib/gravityi/planet/etcd`. This can be achieved using systemd mount files as shown in the example below, or `/etc/fstab`, or some other method. Please consult with your system administrator to determine the best way to meet this requirement.

----
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/<device name>
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd
echo -e "[Mount]\nWhat=/dev/<device name>\nWhere=/var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd\nType=ext4\n[Install]\nWantedBy=local-fs.target" | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/var-lib-gravity-planet-etcd.mount
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable var-lib-gravity-planet-etcd.mount
sudo systemctl start var-lib-gravity-planet-etcd.mount
----


== Anypoint application data device

The main purpose of application data directory is storing application configuration and data. The amount of space required should be at minimum 250GB, but might vary depending on your specific use case. It is important to estimate the minimum size requirements and allocate enough space as a dedicated device ahead of time.

This device will be formatted either as `xfs` or `ext4` and mounted as `/var/lib/data`. You can use the following shell snippet to guide this process (be sure to specify the correct device name in 2 places).

The following is provided only as an example, and should not be used as-is in production. Formatting and mounting disks is something that should be done by your system administrator. The end result of this is mounting the Anypoint application data device to the path `/var/lib/data`. This can be achieved using systemd mount files as shown in the example below, or `/etc/fstab`, or some other method. Please consult with your system administrator to determine the best way to meet this requirement.


----
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/<device name>
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/data
echo -e "[Mount]\nWhat=/dev/<device name>\nWhere=/var/lib/data\nType=ext4\n[Install]\nWantedBy=local-fs.target" | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/var-lib-data.mount
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable var-lib-data.mount
sudo systemctl start var-lib-data.mount

== Docker device

This device is used by Docker’s Device Mapper storage driver.

[NOTE]
It is strongly recommended to have at least 100Gb sized device for the Device Mapper directory - with devices 50Gb and less the system performance will degrade dramatically or might not work at all.


Unless specified, Docker configuration defaults to the use of Device Mapper in loopback mode (using /dev/loopX devices) which is not recommended for production. To configure Docker to use a dedicated device for Device Mapper storage driver, an unformatted device (or a partition) (i.e. /dev/sdd) can be provided during installation. This directory will be automatically configured and set up for use.

Unformatted devices potentially usable for system directory / Device Mapper are automatically discovered by agents running on each node. Discovered devices are offered on a drop-down menu for configuration before the installation is started.

You can list unmounted devices with the following command:
---
lsblk --output=NAME,TYPE,SIZE,FSTYPE -P -I 8,9,202|grep 'FSTYPE=""'
---

Unmounted devices have an empty value in FSTYPE column. Devices with TYPE="part" are partitions on another device. This command only lists specific device types:

|===
|Device type|Description
|8   |SCSI disk devices
|9   |Metadisk (RAID) devices
|202 |Xen virtual block devices (Amazon EC2)

== To Manually Reset Devices and Partitions

Logical Volume Manager allows one to group multiple physical volumes into a single storage volume (Volume Group) and then divide these into Logical
Volumes. Physical Volumes are either a whole device or a partition.

In some cases when a device is in use by another logical volume or you want to manually reset a device previously configured for Device Mapper the following commands may be useful.

The Logical Volume Manager toolset consists of the following commands:
  * dmsetup - is a low-level logical volume management
  * pv/vg/lv-prefixed commands like pvdisplay and pvcreate/pvremove - for working with specific LVM object types (i.e. lv - for logical volumes and vg - for volume groups)

To reset a device use the following commands:
* remove logical volume with `lvremove -f docker/thinpool` (use `lvdisplay` to find the volume to remove)
* remove volume group with `vgremove docker` (use `vgdisplay` to locate the volume group to remove)
* remove physical volume and reset device with `pvremove /dev/<device name>` (use `pvdisplay` to find the physical volume to remove and the device name it is on)
