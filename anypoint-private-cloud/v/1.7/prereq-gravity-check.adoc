= To Verify System Requirements for Anypoint Private Cloud on a Physical Server

After setting up your environment, you can run the `gravity check` script to verify that your system meets the minimum requirements for Anypoint Private Cloud.

. Copy the following from the node where you ran the installer to each node of your cluster:
+
* The `gravity` binary.
* The `app.yaml` manifest used by the `gravity` binary.
+
These files are located in the folder of the installer.

. Run the following command from each node of your cluster:
+
----
sudo ./gravity check --profile=app_node app.yaml
----
+
Valid values of the `--profile` option are:
+
* app_node
* data_node
* demo_node (applicable )

If the command returns no output, this indicates that your environment is setup correctly with the required resources. If your environment does not meet the requirements, the command returns a message describing the problem.
