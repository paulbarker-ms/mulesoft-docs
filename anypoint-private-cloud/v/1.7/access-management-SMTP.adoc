= To Configure SMTP in Anypoint Private Cloud

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition requires that you set up your own SMTP email server to deliver email alerts generated by API Manager and Runtime manager. The SMTP email server also sends email messages for platform infrastructure alerts, including CPU, memory, and disk alerts.

[NOTE]
Only SMTP servers with Authentication are supported (i.e. Anonymous SMTP Relay servers are not supported). +
SMTPS is not supported.

The procedures in this topic describe how to connect to an existing SMTP server. Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition does not provide an SMTP server.
