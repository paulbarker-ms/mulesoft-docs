= To Verify Anypoint Private Cloud Disk Device Requirements

This topic provides information about how to verify that you system meets the minimum prerequisites to install and run the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

== Installing Logical Volume Manager 2 (LVM2)

To install and run Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, you must install and use LVM2. LVM2 is a tool that adds a layer of abstraction between your operating system and the disks/partitions it uses. You must have root access to install LVM2.

You can install LVM using Yum. Yum is an open-source command-line package-management utility for Linux operating systems using the RPM Package Manager. Using Yum, you can install LVM through the following command:

----
sudo yum install lvm2
----

== Verifying Disk Performance

To measure disk throughput, use a tool such as `hdparm`. On CentOS, `hdparm` can be installed by running

----
sudo yum install -y hdparm
----

== Testing Disk Throughput

All disks should have at least 300 MB/sec of throughput. Use the following command to verify the throughput of your disk:

----
sudo hdparm -d <device>
----

For example:

----
$ sudo hdparm -t /dev/sdd

/dev/sdd:
Timing buffered disk reads: 4726 MB in  3.00 seconds = 1574.94 MB/sec
----

You can also measure throughput using the `dd`  tool. `dd` writes directly to the specified file, even if it is a device. Do not use this tool on a bare devices. Instead, after a device is formatted and mounted, you can write to a file on that device to measure throughput.

----
$ sudo mount /dev/sdb /var/lib/gravity # must be already formatted!
$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/lib/gravity/testfile count=1000 bs=1M
1000+0 records in
1000+0 records out
1048576000 bytes (1.0 GB, 1000 MiB) copied, 0.382535 s, 2.7 GB/s
----

The `dd` command provides less accurate information than `hdparm`, but is available on any operating system and provides the ability to easily verify general disk performance.

== Testing Disk IOPS

Depending on your hardware or virtualization provider, you may be able to configure disk IOPS (I/O Operations Per Second). Using a tool like `iops`, you can verify available IOPS:

----
$ sudo ./iops --time 2 /dev/xvdb
/dev/xvdb, 107.37 GB, 32 threads:
 512   B blocks: 1893.0 IO/s, 946.5 KiB/s (  7.8 Mbit/s)
   1 KiB blocks: 1354.8 IO/s,   1.3 MiB/s ( 11.1 Mbit/s)
   2 KiB blocks: 1091.8 IO/s,   2.1 MiB/s ( 17.9 Mbit/s)
   4 KiB blocks:  807.1 IO/s,   3.2 MiB/s ( 26.4 Mbit/s)
   8 KiB blocks:  803.7 IO/s,   6.3 MiB/s ( 52.7 Mbit/s)
  16 KiB blocks:  787.4 IO/s,  12.3 MiB/s (103.2 Mbit/s)
  32 KiB blocks:  700.8 IO/s,  21.9 MiB/s (183.7 Mbit/s)
  64 KiB blocks:  590.0 IO/s,  36.9 MiB/s (309.3 Mbit/s)
 128 KiB blocks:  327.6 IO/s,  40.9 MiB/s (343.5 Mbit/s)
