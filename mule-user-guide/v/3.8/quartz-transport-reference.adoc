= Quartz Transport Reference
:keywords: quartz

[TIP]
When scheduling tasks, use the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/poll-reference[Poll Scope] instead of Quartz.

The Quartz transport provides support for scheduling events and for triggering new events. An inbound quartz endpoint can be used to trigger inbound events that can be repeated, such as every second. Outbound quartz endpoints can be used to schedule an existing event to fire at a later date. Users can create schedules using cron expressions, and events can be persisted in a database.

This transport makes use of the http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/[Quartz Project]. The Quartz site has more generic information about how to work with Quartz.

*Notes:* 

* When running in an environment with multiple workers or nodes, a Quartz scheduler, by default, runs on each node, whereas a Poll Scope only runs on a single node. A Quartz scheduler can be configured to work this way but requires configuration of a JDBC JobStore.
* When using a Quartz inbound endpoint, you cannot manage it through the Schedulers tab.

== About Cron Expressions

A cron expression is a string comprised by six or seven fields separated by white space. Fields can contain any of the allowed values, along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are as follows:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field Name |Mandatory |Allowed Values |Allowed Special Chars
|Seconds |YES |0-59 |, - * /
|Minutes |YES |0-59 |, - * /
|Hours |YES |0-23 |, - * /
|Day of Month |YES |1-31 |, - * ? / L W C
|Month |YES |1-12 or JAN-DEC |, - * /
|Day of Week |YES |1-7 or SUN-SAT |, - * ? / L C #
|Year |NO |empty, 1970-2099 |, - * /
|===

Cron expressions can be as simple as this: +
 `* * * * ? *`

or more complex, like this: +
 `0 0/5 14,18,3-39,52 ? JAN,MAR,SEP MON-FRI 2002-2010`.

Following are some examples:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Expression |Behavior
|0 0 12 * * ? |Fire at 12pm (noon) every day
|0 15 10 ? * * |Fire at 10:15am every day
|0 15 10 * * ? |Fire at 10:15am every day
|0 15 10 * * ? * |Fire at 10:15am every day
|0 15 10 * * ? 2005 |Fire at 10:15am every day during the year 2005
|0 * 14 * * ? |Fire every minute starting at 2pm and ending at 2:59pm, every day
|0 0/5 14 * * ? |Fire every 5 minutes starting at 2pm and ending at 2:55pm, every day
|1 1 1 1,6 * ? |Fire the first day of January and the first day of June, every year (in the first second of the first minute of the first hour) +
|===

If you are not familiar with cron syntax, don't be intimidated! It's reasonably easy to learn, here is a http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.1.x/tutorials/crontrigger[good tutorial], or you can even leverage online tools that can build cron expressions for you.

== About Jobs

Jobs are used to perform an action when a time trigger occurs from the Quartz transport. Mule provides a number of jobs for generating and scheduling events. These are detailed below. Users can also write their own jobs and hook them in using the custom-job type included with Mule.

== Connector

The Quartz connector is used to configure the default behavior for Quartz endpoints that reference the connector. Note if there is only one Quartz connector configured, all Quartz endpoints will use that connector.

=== Attributes of <connector...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description
|scheduler-ref |Provides an implementation of the Quartz Scheduler interface. If no value is provided, a scheduler is retrieved from the StdSchedulerFactory. If no properties are provided, the getDefaultScheduler method is called. Otherwise, a new factory instance is created using the given properties, and a scheduler is retrieved using the getScheduler method.

*Type*: string +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none

=== Child elements of <connector...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|factory-property |0..* |Set a property on the factory (see scheduler-ref).
|===

[NOTE]
====
When setting the `org.quartz.scheduler.instanceName` factory property, be sure to *avoid duplicate names*.

The value of `instanceName` must be different for every Quartz connector running in the same Mule instance, even if in different applications.

[source, xml]
----
<quartz:factory-property key="org.quartz.scheduler.instanceName" value="MuleScheduler1"/>
----

If Quartz connectors share the same value for `instanceName` property, these connectors could miss firing the scheduled jobs in the applications in which they exist.

== Outbound Endpoint

An outbound Quartz endpoint allows existing events to be stored and fired at a later time/date. If you are using a persistent event store, the payload of the event must implement java.io.Serializable. You configure an org.quartz.Job implementation on the endpoint to tell it what action to take. Mule has some default jobs, but you can also write your own.

== Endpoint

A global endpoint that can be used as a template to create inbound and outbound Quartz endpoints. Common configuration can be set on a global endpoint and then referenced using the @ref attribute on the local endpoint. Note that because jobs sometimes only work on inbound or outbound endpoints, they have to be set on the local endpoint.

== Endpoint Polling Job

An inbound endpoint job that can be used to periodically read from an external source (via another endpoint). This can be useful for triggering time-based events from sources that do not support polling or for simply controlling the rate in which events are received from the source.

<flow name="testFlow3" doc:name="testFlow3">
  <description>The endpoint polling Job tries and performs a 'request' on any Mule
  endpoint. If a result is received, it hands off to this 'testFlow3' flow

== Scheduled Dispatch Job

An outbound job that schedules a job for dispatch at a later time/date. The event gets dispatched using the configured endpoint reference.

=== Child Elements of <scheduled-dispatch-job...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|job-endpoint |0..1 |The endpoint used to dispatch the scheduled event. The preferred approach is to create a global endpoint and reference it using the ref attribute. However, you can also use the address attribute to define a URI endpoint (which supports expressions). You can use the timeout attribute to specify an arbitrary time-out value associated with the endpoint that can be used by jobs that block waiting to receive events.
|===

Example

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<description>
  This outbound Quartz endpoint receives an event after the component
  has processed it and stores it in the event store. When the trigger
  kicks in at 10:15am everyday, it dispatches the event on the endpoint
  referenced as 'scheduledDispatchEndpoint'. Since the 'repeatCount'
  is set to 0, the event is only sent out once.

== Custom Job From Message

Allows a job to be stored on the current message. This can only be used on outbound
endpoints. When the message is received, the job is read and the job is added to the
scheduler with the current message. This allows for custom scheduling behavior determined
by the message itself. Usually the flow or a transformer would create the job on the
message based on application-specific logic. Any Mule-supported expressions can be used
to read the job from the message. Typically, you add the job as a header, but an
attachment could also be used.

  the job from an attachment or even a property within the payload itself.
