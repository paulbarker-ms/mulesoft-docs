= To Batch-Write to a File

In this procedure, a database connector retrieves data from two tables. Mule feeds this data into Transform Message inside the Batch Commit. In Transform Message, DataWeave maps the data from a Java.util.HashMap to the CSV format. A file connector writes the resulting CSV file to disk. A logger component writes processing details to the console.

This procedure uses a MySQL sample database, which you can import. Download the SQL script using the following URL:

`+https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/_attachments/create.sample.db.sql+`

The script creates the _company_ database that has tables named employees and roles.

. In Studio, create a new project, and drag connectors onto the canvas as follows:
+
* Drag Poll onto the canvas.
* Drag and put Processor Chain inside Poll.
* Drag and put Database inside Processor Chain.
* Drag Batch Step onto the canvas in the _process_ section.
* Drag and put Batch Commit inside Batch Step.
* Drag and put Transform and File inside Batch Commit.
* Put Logger in the _on complete_ section of Batch Step, as shown in the following screenshot:
+

+
. In Database properties, click Add image:Add-16x16.png[add], and set the following options:
* Host: The name of the host running MySQL.
* Port: *3306*
* User and Password: Your database user name and password.
* Database: *company*
* MySQL Driver: Browse to the location of and select the driver that is compatible with your database.
+
Test and save the settings.
+
. In Database properties, set options according to the following table:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Value
|*Operation* |`Select`
|*Query Type* |`Parameterized`
|*Parameterized SQL Statement* |`SELECT no, first_name, last_name, role FROM employees INNER JOIN roles ON employees.no = roles.emp_no`
|===
+
. Double-click Transform Message to open its configuration.
+
Datasense should build the input side of your transform. If not, to instruct DataWeave to process the MySQL data, right-click Payload on the left and click Set Metadata.
+

+
. In Select Metadata Type, define the metadata as type *Map*, comprised of type *List<Element>*. Add the names and data types of the employees table database:
+
* first_name, String
* last_name, String
* no, Integer
* role, String
+

The Transform Message configuration appears as follows.

+
The resulting DataWeave code is auto-generated:
+
[source,code,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/csv
---
payload map ((payload01 , indexOfPayload01) -> {
	column_0: payload01.first_name,
	column_1: payload01.last_name,
	column_2: payload01.no,
	column_3: payload01.role
})
----
+
. Configure the File connector to save the CSV file to your file system.
. Configure the Logger to output the following message at log level `INFO`.
+
[source, code, linenums]
----
Total Records exported: #[message.payload.getLoadedRecords()], Failed Records: #[message.payload.getFailedRecords()], Processing time: #[message.payload.getElapsedTimeInMillis()]
----
. Run the app, and check that the results appear in the file on your file system. Check the console and verify that logged messages appear as expected. For example:
+
`INFO  2017-08-14 09:42:47,170 [batch-job-myprojectBatch-work-manager.02] org.mule.api.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: Total Records exported: 100, Failed Records: 0, Processing time: 516`
+
. In the properties editor, click Terminate image:eclipse-terminate.png[stop app] to stop the app from running every ten minutes.
