= Jetty Transport
:keywords: mule, esb, studio, jetty, SSL

The Jetty transport provides support for exposing applications over HTTP by embedding a light-weight Jetty server. The link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/jetty-ssl-transport[Jetty SSL Transport] works the same way but over SSL. You can only define inbound endpoints with this transport.

The Javadoc for this transport can be found below:

http://www.mulesoft.org/docs/site/3.8.0/apidocs/org/mule/transport/servlet/jetty/JettyHttpConnector.html[Jetty Transport Javadoc]

The connector allows Mule to expose Mule Services over HTTP using a Jetty HTTP server. A single Jetty server is created for each connector instance. One connector can serve many endpoints. Users should rarely need to have more than one Jetty connector. The Jetty connector can be configured using a Jetty XML config file, but the default configuration is sufficient for most scenarios.
