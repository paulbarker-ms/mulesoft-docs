= Component Configuration Reference
:keywords: anypoint, studio, components

This page provides details on the elements you configure for components. This information is pulled directly from `mule.xsd` and is cached. For more information on components, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/configuring-components[Configuring Components].

== Component

A simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) component that's invoked by Mule when a message is received. The class or object instance to be used can be specified using a child object factory element, or via the `class` attribute. If the `class` attribute is used, an object factory cannot be configured as well. Using the `class` attribute is equivalent to using the prototype object factory (`prototype-object` child element).

=== Attributes of Component

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Name |Description
|`class` |Specifies a component class. This is a shortcut that is equivalent to providing a `prototype-object` element.

*Type*: `class name` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|===

=== Child Elements of Component

[%header,cols="30a,10a,60a"]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|`abstract-interceptor` |0..1 |A placeholder for an interceptor element.
|`interceptor-stack` |0..1 |A reference to a globally defined stack of interceptors.
|`abstract-object-factory` |0..1 |Object factory used to obtain the object instance that is used for the component implementation. The object factory is responsible for object creation and may implement different patterns, such as a singleton or prototype, or look up an instance from other object containers.
|`abstract-lifecycle-adapter-factory` |0..1 |Abstract lifecycle adapter factory
|`binding` |0..* |A binding associates a Mule endpoint with an injected Java interface. This is like using Spring to inject a bean, but instead of calling a method on the bean, a message is sent to an endpoint.
|`abstract-entry-point-resolver-set` |0..1 |A placeholder for entry point resolver set elements. These combine a group of entry point resolvers, trying them in turn until one succeeds.
|`abstract-entry-point-resolver `|0..1 |A placeholder for an entry point resolver element. Entry point resolvers define how payloads are delivered to Java code by choosing the method to call.
|===

== Pooled Component

A pooled POJO (Plain Old Java Object) component to invoke by Mule when a message is received. The instance can be specified via a factory or a class.

Attributes of pooled-component:

|`abstract-pooling-profile` |0..1 |Characteristics of the object pool.
|===

== Pooling Profile

*Attributes of pooling-profile:*

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Name |Description
|`maxActive` |Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that may be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted.

*Type*: `string` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`maxIdle` |Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that may be idle at one time.

*Type*: `string` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`initialisationPolicy` |Determines how components in a pool should be initialized.

Possible values are:

* `INITIALISE_NONE` - Does not load components into the pool on startup.
* `INITIALISE_ONE` - Loads one initial component into the pool on startup.
* `INITIALISE_ALL` - Loads all components in the pool on startup.

*Type*: `enumeration` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `INITIALISE_ONE`
|`exhaustedAction` |Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted.

Possible values are:

* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL` - Throws a `NoSuchElementException`.
* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT` - Blocks by invoking `Object.wait(long)` until a new or idle object is available.
* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW` - Creates a new Mule instance and returns it, essentially making `maxActive` meaningless. If a positive `maxWait` value is supplied, it blocks for at most that many milliseconds, after which a `NoSuchElementException` is thrown. If `maxThreadWait` is a negative value, it blocks indefinitely.

*Type*: `enumeration` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW`
|`maxWait` |Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the exhaustedAction is set to `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT`.

*Type*: `string` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`evictionCheckIntervalMillis` |Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed.

*Type*: `string` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`minEvictionMillis` |Determines the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects are evicted from the pool due to idle time alone.

*Type*: `string` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
