= HTTP Connector
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, connectors, http, https, http headers, query parameters, rest, raml

== Introduction

he HTTP connector sends and receives HTTP or HTTPS requests using a host, port, and address. Find the two important use cases for this component below.

Depending on your needs, you can either:

* Use the connector as an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-listener-connector[HTTP Listener Connector] for requests that arrive at a certain address, subsequently generating an HTTP response
* Use the connector as an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-request-connector[HTTP Request Connector] to send requests to a certain address and receive the returned response

Through additional configuration, the connector allows you to:

* Use link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/tls-configuration[TLS] encryption to send or receive *HTTPS* requests 
* Send link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/authentication-in-http-requests[Authenticated Requests], via *Basic Authentication, Digest and OAuth*

[NOTE]
====
*HTTP connector in Mule 3.6 and newer*

As of Mule 3.6 and newer, the HTTP and HTTPS endpoint-based connectors and transports have been replaced by a *single HTTP operation-based connector* which supports HTTPS.

In Studio, the HTTP connector can work in one of two ways, depending on where it's placed in a flow:

* As an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-listener-connector[HTTP Listener]
* As an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-request-connector[HTTP Requester]

== HTTP Listener Quick Reference for Studio Users

To instantiate the connector as an *HTTP listener connector*, you must place it onto a blank Anypoint Studio canvas into the *Source* section of a new flow (i.e. as the first element in the flow) as you design your Mule application:

.New Flow Showing Source and Process Phases

.Drag the HTTP connector to the Source side
image:http-connector-drag-to-source.png[drag to source]

.See the connector populate the Source side

== HTTP Requester Quick Reference

To instantiate the connector as an *HTTP request connector*, you must place it into the *Process* section of a flow (ie: anywhere except the beginning of it):

.Drag the HTTP connector to the Process side
image:http-connector-drag-to-process.png[drag to process]

.Flow showing HTTP connector in Process side

[tab,title="XML Editor"]

When writing Mule projects in XML, the HTTP connector can work in one of two ways, depending on how you create it:

* As an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-listener-connector[HTTP Listener]
* As an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-request-connector[HTTP Requester]

To instantiate the connector as an HTTP Listener Connector, add the following XML tag at the start of a flow:

[source,xml]
----
<http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/" />
----

This element must reference a global configuration element of the following type:

[source,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" host="localhost" port="8081" />
----

To instantiate the connector as an HTTP Request Connector, add the following XML tag in any part of a flow:

[source,xml]
----
<http:request config-ref="HTTP_Request_Configuration" path="/" method="GET" />
----

This element must reference a global configuration element of the following type:


[source,xml]
----
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_Configuration" host="example.com" port="8081"/>
----

....
------

[TIP]
To migrate a project that uses the old link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/deprecated-http-transport-reference[HTTP endpoint-based connector] to the new HTTP operation-based connector, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/migrating-to-the-new-http-connector[Migrating to the New HTTP Connector]. The old HTTP endpoint-based connector still works with Mule runtime 3.6, but it's deprecated and will eventually be removed.

[TIP]
You can edit the log4j2 configuration file to make the logging of the HTTP connector's activity a lot more verbose, if you need to. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/logging-in-mule[Logging in Mule] for instructions.

== Debugging

Gaining visibility into HTTP inbound and outbound behavior can be achieved by enabling underlying library loggers with log4j2. This section assumes you're comfortable adjusting log levels with log4j2. If you have not adjusted logging levels in the past, read link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/logging-in-mule#configuring-custom-logging-settings[configuring custom logging settings] before continuing.

=== Logging Listener and Request Activity

By enabling the `DEBUG` level on `org.mule.module.http.internal.HttpMessageLogger`, activity coming from all HTTP Listener and Request components will be logged. This includes the HTTP Listener Connector's inbound request, HTTP Request Connector's outbound request, and each connector's response body. An example of each can be found below.


[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Listener Log Output"]
....

The log output of the Listener will display metadata of the inbound request.

[source,bash]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 10:55:03,234 [[hello].HTTP_Listener_Configuration.worker.01] org.mule.module.http.internal.HttpMessageLogger: LISTENER
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8081
User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
Accept: */*
----

It will also display information about the response being sent back.

[source,bash]
----
LISTENER
HTTP/1.1 200
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Date: Wed, 10 Feb 2016 18:55:03 GMT

2000
{
  "message" : "hello, world"
}
----

[TIP]
Chunked encoding will produce a separate log record for each chunk.

....
[tab,title="Request Log Output"]
....

The log output of the Request will display metadata of the outbound request.

[source,bash]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 11:29:18,647 [[hello].http.requester.HTTP_Request_Configuration(1) SelectorRunner] org.mule.module.http.internal.HttpMessageLogger: REQUESTER
GET /v3/hello HTTP/1.1
Host: mocker-server.cloudhub.io:80
User-Agent: AHC/1.0
Connection: keep-alive
Accept: */*
----

It will also display information about the response sent back from the target.

[source,bash]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 11:29:18,729 [[hello].http.requester.HTTP_Request_Configuration.worker(1)] org.mule.module.http.internal.HttpMessageLogger: REQUESTER

Content-Type: application/json

Server: nginx
Content-Length: 10940
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "message" : "Hello, world"
}
----

....
------

=== Logging Packet Metadata

At a lower level, it can be desirable to log the actual request and response packets transmitted over HTTP. This is achieved by enabling the `DEBUG` level on `com.ning.http.client.providers.grizzly`. This will log the metadata of the request packets from `AsyncHTTPClientFilter` and the response packets from `AhcEventFilter`. Unlike the `HttpMessageLogger`, this will not log request or response bodies.

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Request Log Output"]
....

The log output of the request packet's metadata is as follows.

[source,bash]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 11:16:29,421 [[hello].http.requester.HTTP_Request_Configuration(1) SelectorRunner] com.ning.http.client.providers.grizzly.AsyncHttpClientFilter: REQUEST: HttpRequestPacket (
   method=GET
   url=/v3/hello
   query=null
   protocol=HTTP/1.1
   content-length=-1
   headers=[
      Host=mocker-server.cloudhub.io:80
      User-Agent=AHC/1.0
      Connection=keep-alive
      Accept=*/*]
)
----

....
[tab,title="Response Log Output"]
....

The log output of the response packet's metadata is as follows.

[source,bash]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 11:16:29,508 [[hello].http.requester.HTTP_Request_Configuration.worker(1)] com.ning.http.client.providers.grizzly.AhcEventFilter: RESPONSE: HttpResponsePacket (
  status=200
  reason=
  protocol=HTTP/1.1
  content-length=10940
  committed=false
  headers=[
      content-type=application/json
      date=Wed, 10 Feb 2016 19:16:29 GMT
      server=nginx
      content-length=10940
      connection=keep-alive]
)
----

....
------

== Non-blocking Processing

The HTTP Connector (both the HTTP Listener and the HTTP Request connector) can be used with a non-blocking processing strategy. +
This means that whenever a message is pending a response from an external source, the message processor will still be free to process other messages that keep arriving to it. Read more about this in link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/flow-processing-strategies#non-blocking-processing-strategy[Non-Blocking Processing Strategy].

To enable the non-blocking processing strategy, you must set this as a property in the '<flow>' element on which the HTTP Connector sits.

[NOTE]
Note that link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/flow-processing-strategies#supported-non-blocking-components[not all Mule components] currently support the non-blocking processing strategy, if there are any unsupported components in a flow, they will cause the flow to fall back to synchronous processing.
