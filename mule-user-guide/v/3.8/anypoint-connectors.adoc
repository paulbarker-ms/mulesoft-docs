*Anypoint Connectors* facilitate integration of Mule applications with third-party APIs and standard integration protocols, providing a means to access web services and resources. Use our connectors within your Mule flows to send and receive data over a protocol or using an API.

== Installing

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

== Using a Connector

You can configure and use a connector in Anypoint Studio following its particular setup guidelines, respecting the functionality and limitations of the API or protocol the connector supports. For a tutorial on basic connector usage, see our link:/getting-started/anypoint-connector[Anypoint Connector quickstart].

Import additional connectors into your Studio instance, or manually create applications using connectors, that is outside of the Studio development environment, by adding them as Maven dependencies or including the required connector libraries with your project.

The following shows the relationship of connectors to other components in the Anypoint Platform:
