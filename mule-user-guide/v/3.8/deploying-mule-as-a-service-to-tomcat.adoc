= Deploying Mule as a Service to Tomcat
:keywords: deploy, deploying, tomcat

This page describes two activities that let you deploy your Mule applications on a Tomcat Web server:

* Install Mule as a service on an Apache Tomcat server 

* Set up your Mule applications for hot deployment

For more information on hot deploying Mule applications, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/application-server-based-hot-deployment[Application Server Based Hot Deployment].

== Installing Mule on Tomcat

The following instructions have been verified for use with Mule 3.7.3 and newer:

. link:http://tomcat.apache.org[Download] and install Apache Tomcat, following Apache's installation instructions.
. In the Tomcat home directory on your system, add the following line to the `conf/server.xml` file:
+
[source, xml]
----
<Listener className="org.mule.module.tomcat.MuleTomcatListener" />
----
+
. Create a `mule-libs` subdirectory under the Tomcat home directory.
. Copy the contents of the Mule `lib` folder with all its subdirectories – *except* `/boot` to the `mule-libs/` subdirectory of your Tomcat home directory. Do not flatten the directory structure.
. Copy the `mule-module-tomcat-<version>.jar` file to the `mule-libs/mule/` directory in your Tomcat home directory.
. Copy the following libraries from your Mule `lib/boot/` directory to your Tomcat `mule-libs/opt/`directory:

* `commons-cli-1.2.jar`
* `disruptor-3.3.0.jar`
* `jcl-over-slf4j-1.7.7.jar`
* `log4j-api-2.1.jar`
* `log4j-core-2.1.jar`
* `log4j-jcl-2.1.jar`
* `log4j-slf4j-impl-2.1.jar`
* `slf4j-api-1.7.7.jar`
* `wrapper-3.5.26.jar`
. In the Tomcat `conf/catalina.properties` file, add the following to `common.loader` (preceded by a comma to separate it from existing values):
+
[source]
----
${catalina.base}/lib,${catalina.base}/lib/*.jar,${catalina.home}/lib,${catalina.home}/lib/*.jar,${catalina.home}/mule-libs/user/*.jar,${catalina.home}/mule-libs/mule/*.jar,${catalina.home}/mule-libs/opt/*.jar,${catalina.home}/mule-libs/endorsed/*.jar 
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure you have only one listener in your web.xml file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<listener> 
<listener-class> 
org.mule.module.tomcat.MuleTomcatListener 
</listener-class> 
</listener> 
----
====

== Deploying Mule Applications in Tomcat

. Package your Mule application's configuration files and custom Java classes in a `.war` file (see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/application-server-based-hot-deployment[Application Server Based Hot Deployment]).
. In the Maven project, all Mule provided dependencies, that is, any library provided in the `mule-libs` directory, must have a `<scope>provided</scope>` definition to prevent classloading conflicts between duplicated libraries.
. Copy your application's `.war` file, then paste it in the Tomcat `/webapps` directory.
. Tomcat hot deploys the application.

If you need to make a change to the configuration or Java file in the Mule application, modify the file in the expanded directory under the Tomcat `/webapps` directory, then touch the `web.xml` file (for example, simply add and delete a space in the file and then save it). These actions trigger Tomcat to redeploy the application.

Alternatively, you can modify the application's source files, repackage them as a `.war` file, then drop the new `.war` file into the `/webapps` directory to trigger Tomcat to redeploy the application.
