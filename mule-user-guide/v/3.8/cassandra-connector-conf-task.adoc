= To Configure Cassandra Authentication

The Cassandra connector configuration needs to match the Cassandra configuration with regard to Basic Authentication. By default, accessing the Cassandra database does not require credentials. You need to configure Cassandra to enable authentication. After enabling authentication, you can start cqlsh from the Cassandra installation home directory as shown in this example that uses default credentials cassandra/cassandra:

----
bin/cqlsh localhost -u cassandra -p cassandra
Connected to Test Cluster at localhost:9042.
[cqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 3.10 | CQL spec 3.4.4 | Native protocol v4]
Use HELP for help.
----

. After installing Cassandra, open `conf\cassandra.yaml` for editing.
. Optionally, change the value of AllowAllAuthenticator to PasswordAuthenticator. 
. Restart Cassandra.
. In a separate terminal tab, check that Cassandra is running:
+
`bin/nodetool status`
