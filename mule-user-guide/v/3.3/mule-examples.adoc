= Mule Examples

Mule provides a suite of tools to help you learn more about building applications in Studio and Mule Standalone. Walk through the <<Studio Configurations>> to learn the basics, or skip forward to learn from the <<Examples and Templates>> applications you can build using Mule ESB.

== Studio Configurations

In order to demonstrate some of the key configuration activities in Mule Studio, review the videos and instructions in the *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/studio-basics-walkthrough[Studio Basics Walkthrough]* section. Launch Studio and try mimicking the activities so as to gain familiarity and confidence in working with Studio.

== Examples and Templates

*Mule Examples* offer insight into how you can use Mule to manage system connection and integration situations. Based on real-life business use cases, the examples demonstrate Mule's powerful features and functionality, and suggest how you can take advantage of them.

Mule ESB 3.3 Community Edition (CE) and Mule ESB 3.3 Enterprise Edition (EE) include *Templates* of Mule example applications in the bundled download. These templates help you build a Mule application without having to start from scratch. You can use either the <<Using a Studio Template>>, Mule ESB's graphical interface, or the <<Using a Standalone Example>> from your computer's console, to quickly create your own applications in Mule ESB.

== Using a Studio Template

. If you haven't already done so, visit http://www.mulesoft.org[www.mulesoft.org] and download the free http://www.mulesoft.org/download-mule-esb-community-edition[Community Edition of Mule ESB]. Follow the instructions on the website to launch *Mule Studio* and select a workspace. (Alternatively, you can download and use the 30-day free trial of http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-esb-open-source-esb[Mule ESB Enterprise Edition].)
. Click the `File` menu and select `New` > `Mule Project`.
. In the *New Mule Project* panel that appears, enter a *Name* for your new project and provide a brief *Description*, if you wish.
+

. In the *Server Runtime* field, select the runtime version of Mule that you wish to use.

* select `Mule Server 3.3.0 CE` if you downloaded the free Community Edition of Mule.
* select `Mule Server 3.3.0 EE` if you downloaded the Enterprise Edition of Mule
+

. Click the box next to *Create project based on an existing template*.

. Click a line item to select the template you wish to use to build your project.
+

+
image:avail_EE.png[avail_EE]

. Click *Finish*. Mule Studio creates and opens the new project, complete with pre-built and pre-configured flows.
. In the *Package Explorer* pane in Studio, right-click the project name, then select `Run As > Mule Application`. Studio runs the application and Mule is up and kicking!
. To stop the application from running, click the red *Terminate* button in Studio's *Console*.

== Using a Standalone Example

. If you haven't already done so, visit http://www.mulesoft.org[www.mulesoft.org] and download the free http://www.mulesoft.org/download-mule-esb-community-edition[*Community Edition of Mule ESB*]. (Alternatively, you can download and use the 30-day free trial of http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-esb-open-source-esb[*Mule ESB Enterprise Edition*].)
. Navigate to the folder that contains your copy of *Mule ESB Standalone*.
. Locate the `Examples` folder, then the folder for the example you wish to run.
. Copy the pre-built application archive (the `.zip` file) for the example.
. Paste the copy of the `.zip` file in the Mule applications folder, `$MULE_HOME/apps`. For example, to run the Flight Reservation example, copy `mule-example-flight-reservation-3.3.0.zip` and move the copy to the `$MULE_HOME/examples` folder.
+
image:copy_archive.png[copy_archive]
+
[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can build the example in a build tool such as *Ant* or *Maven*.

. Run `ant` or `mvn` in your Ant or Maven build tool, respectively.
. The build tool compiles the example classes, produces an application zip file and copies it to your `$MULE_HOME/apps` folder.
====

. Start Mule.
[TIP]
====
 Need more detail?

. Open a new command line. +
 *PC*: Open the *Console*. +
 *Mac*: Open the *Terminal* application (Applications > Utilities > Terminal).
. Access the directory and folder in which you pasted the zip file for your example (i.e. the application folder in Mule). For example, type `cd /Users/aaron/Downloads/mule-standalone-3.3.0/`
. Start Mule. For example, type `./bin/mule`
====

. After it starts, Mule polls the `apps` and `examples` folders every 5 seconds; it picks up the applications you copied to the `examples` folder, then deploys it automatically. In the first command line, Mule notifies you that it has deployed the example application.
. To stop the application from running, hit **CTRL-C**.
