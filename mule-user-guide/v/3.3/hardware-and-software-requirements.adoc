== Setting up your Mule Environment

Before installing and running Mule, you must install the following software on your system:

=== Java

Install one of the following versions of the http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java Developer Kit]:

* Standard Edition 1.6.0_26 (also known as JDK SE 6 Update 26) or more recent, including SE 7

Run the installer, following the instructions that appear on the screen.

For further details, consult: link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/installing-and-endorsing-the-jdk[Installing and Endorsing the JDK]

=== Maven (Optional But Recommended)

. Download the Maven distribution from the http://maven.apache.org/[Maven web site] and unpack it to any folder (for example, `C:\Apache`). MuleSoft ESB 3.2 users should use Maven 3.
. Create a Maven repository directory with no spaces in the path, such as `c:\.m2\repository` on Windows. (If Windows Explorer does not allow you to create the .m2 folder name, use the `mkdir` command in a console window instead.)
. Open the `settings.xml` file in your Maven `conf` directory (for example, `c:\apache-maven-3.0.3\conf`) and specify the repository directory. For example:
+
[source, xml]
----
<localRepository>c:/.m2/repository</localRepository>
----
+
