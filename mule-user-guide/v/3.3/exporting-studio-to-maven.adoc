= Converting Studio into Maven

You may wish to convert a Mule project that was created in Mule Studio into a http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] project. This page describes how to use Studio's native support for the "mavenization" of a Mule project. 

== Mavenizing an Existing Mule Project

If you have an existing Studio project that was created without Maven support enabled, you can now convert it into a "Mavenized" Mule project. 

. Left-click the name of your project in the Package Explorer.
. Select *Maven Support in Studio > Mavenize*.
. Studio presents a confirmation dialog, warning that although Maven support can later be disabled, this will not reset your project's classpath. Click *Yes* to confirm.
. Studio creates a `pom.xml` file for your project. You can observe the progress in the Console. 
. When the mavenization process is complete, the `pom.xml` file for your project appears in the Package Explorer underneath the `mule-project.xml` file.

== Running a Mavenized Project

You can now run your project on the embedded server in Mule Studio either as a Mule Application or as a Mule Application with Maven. You can also package your Mule project from the command line by executing the following syntax:

`mvn package`

The maven-mule-plugin packages the project in a `.zip` file.  Deploy the `.zip` file in the `apps` folder to your standalone Mule ESB instance to run the application.
