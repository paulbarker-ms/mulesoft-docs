= Anypoint Connectors

== Overview

=== What is an Anypoint Connector?

*Anypoint(TM) Connectors* facilitate easy integration of your Mule applications with third-party APIs. Use them within your application's flow to send and receive data via a specific API. 

Selected Anypoint Connectors are automatically bundled with Mule Studio, but there is a large library of additional connectors available for download. 

=== When do I need a connector vs. an endpoint?

Connectors function like endpoints by sending and receiving data over a transport. However, while endpoints are generic for a widely-used protocol (such as JDBC, FTP, HTTP, POP3, etc) each connector is built to optimize the connection with a specific third-party API, such as Salesforce or Twitter.

Endpoints will serve your needs in most cases where you are connecting to something that has a standard format or protocol. For example, if you are connecting to an Oracle database or a MS SQL database, you can use the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/database-jdbc-endpoint-reference[JDBC endpoint], because those databases output their data in a standard format. There is no need for an Oracle or MS SQL connector. Similarly, you don't need a connector for a particular kind of file, like a .csv file. The link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/file-endpoint-reference[File endpoint] can be configured to input and output data to any kind of text file format, including .csv, so there is no need for a csv connector. 

=== What if I need a connector that isn't listed on the extensions site?

If none of the connectors meet your needs and your use case is not covered by an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/studio-endpoints[endpoint], you have several options:

* Contact MuleSoft and the community via the https://forums.mulesoft.com[MuleSoft Forum] – either MuleSoft or a member of the community might be in the process of building the connector you need or can point you to a community-built connector hosted elsewhere.
* Consider building your own. Check out the link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.3/mule-devkit[Anypoint Connector DevKit] documentation for more information.

== Connector Support Categories

Connectors fall into one of the following categories. See https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Connector Support Policy] for more information.

|Type |Description
|*Community*
|

MuleSoft or members of the MuleSoft community write and maintain the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?search=community[Community connectors]]. Connectors built by the community or MuleSoft are generally open-source, although each package may vary. Partner-built connectors may not be open-source. Contact the partner directly for more information. You do not need any special account or license to use a Community connector.

|*MuleSoft Certified*
|

https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?search=mulesoft-certified[MuleSoft Certified connectors] are developed by MuleSoft’s partners and developer community and are reviewed and certified by MuleSoft. For support, customers should contact the MuleSoft partner that created the MuleSoft Certified connector.

|*Select*
|

MuleSoft maintains https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?search=select[Select connectors]. Connectors included in the open source Mule distribution can be used by everyone, however support is only included in an Anypoint Platform subscription. To use all other Select Connectors and access support, you must have an active Anypoint Platform subscription.

|*Premium*

== Accessing Connectors

=== Mule Studio

Mule Studio includes a number of bundled connectors in the standard download. See the table below for more information about these connectors. 

MuleSoft and members of the Mule community have developed dozens more connectors that you can use in your applications. Refer to the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/installing-connectors[Installing Connectors] documentation to learn how to download and install connectors in Mule Studio.

The following table summarizes the Anypoint connectors that come bundled with the Mule Studio download.

|Web Service API |Description
|CMIS |Using this connector, your Mule application can interact with any CMS system that implements the Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) specification.
|Magento |Using this connector, your Mule application can interact with Magento, a feature-rich eCommerce platform built on open-source technology that provides online merchants with great control over the look, content and functionality of their eCommerce store.
|MongoDB |Using this connector, your Mule application can connect to a MongoDB instance and run almost all of the operations that can be performed from the command line.
|Salesforce |Using this connector, your Mule application can connect with the Salesforce API for querying, creating, and updating information using either regular username and password through the SOAP API or using OAuth as the authentication mechanism.
|Twilio |Using this connector, your Mule application can interact with the Twilio REST API for building voice applications and for sending SMS messages.
|Twitter |Using this connector, your Mule application can interact with the Twitter REST API, which provides simple interfaces for most Twitter functionality.

=== Standalone

If you are developing your applications in an XML editor outside of Mule Studio, you can install Anypoint connectors as Maven dependencies. To make the connector available to a Mavenized Mule application, add the connector repositories to your `pom.xml` file, add the module as a dependency, and add it to the packaging process of your applications.

You can find the latest installation links and instructions for each connector on the connector-specific reference pages, accessible from the connectors site.


=== Installing Connectors

MuleSoft and members of the Mule community have developed dozens of extra connectors that you can use in your applications. Refer to the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/installing-connectors[Installing Connectors]  documentation to learn how to download and install connectors in Mule Studio and Maven.

=== Configuring Connectors 

For configuration information specific to individual connectors, refer to the specific references for individual connectors provided on the connectors site. Each connector page has links to connector documentation, video examples, and complete example code.

=== Connector Compatibility

Starting with (and including) Mule 3.2, MuleSoft has made all connectors forward-compatible with all new releases of Mule. This group of connectors, which are referred to as **3.2-compatible** or **Studio-compatible**, can be configured either through the Properties pane in the Mule Studio visual interface or through an XML editor.

Connectors developed prior to Mule ESB 3.2 can be deployed only with the version of Mule for which they were developed. In other words, these legacy connectors are neither forward nor backward-compatible.

Legacy connectors cannot be configured or deployed by Mule Studio, which debuted with Mule 3.2. Instead, you must configure all legacy connectors with an XML editor, then deploy them exclusively with the Mule release for which they are listed as compatible.
