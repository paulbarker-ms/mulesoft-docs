= Salesforce Connector Reference
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, connector, endpoint, salesforce

The Salesforce Connector enacts API calls targeting Salesforce's SOAP API, REST API, Bulk API, or Streaming API, depending on the operation that you configure. The connector's API calls to Salesforce use an XML request/response over an HTTPS connection. All required request headers, error handling, and HTTPS connection configuration are abstracted from the user and built into the connector. 

This page summarizes the essential configuration parameters for the current version of the Salesforce connector:

* Creating a global connector configuration using username/password/securityToken or via OAuth
* Selecting the appropriate <<Operations>> for your use case.

This page does not list the attributes of each operation. For introductory information, access the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/salesforce-connector[Salesforce Connector] documentation.

*Note*: Additional versions of the Salesforce connector reference information are available at the http://mulesoft.github.io/mule-salesforce-connector/[GitHub Salesforce Connector site].

== Global Salesforce Connector Configuration

Depending on whether you are using OAuth to connect to your Salesforce account, configure your connector with one of these global configurations.

* `sfdc:config`
* `sfdc:config-with-oauth`

Note that if you select `sfdc:config-with-oauth`, you must also configure an <<Configuring the Authorization Flow>> to acquire an access token. This access token is referenced via an `accessTokenId` attribute in all Salesforce operations configured to use an OAuth connection.

For non-OAuth configurations, Mule performs the authentication with Salesforce within the same flow as the Salesforce operation itself – no separate authorization flow is required.

=== Global Configuration 

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Element |Description
|*sfdc:config* |Use to configure a connection to your Salesforce account.
|===

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Description |Required? |Default Value
|*name* |Defines unique identifier for global element |X | 
|*username* |Username used to initialize the session |X | 
|*password* |Password used to authenticate the user |X | 
|*securityToken* |User's security token |X | 
|*url* |Salesforce endpoint URL | + |+https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/30.0+
|*proxyHost* |Hostname of the proxy |  | 
|*proxyPort* |Port of the proxy |  | 
|*proxyUsername* |Username used to authenticate against the proxy |  | 
|*proxyPassword* |Password used to authenticate against the proxy |  | 
|*sessionId* |This value could be used for specifying an active Salesforce session. Required connection parameters will be used in case of reconnection. |  | 
|*serviceEndpoint* |Specifies the service endpoint. This value is only used if you configure the sessionId attribute. Otherwise, the service endpoint is retrieved from the login results. |  | 
|===

If you wish, you can customize the automatic connection management by explicitly configuring a connection pool to specify the parameters. For more information, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/tuning-performance[Tuning Performance].

You can also optionally configure a reconnection strategy using the reconnection child element. For more information, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/configuring-reconnection-strategies[Configuring Reconnection Strategies].

=== Global Configuration with OAuth

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Element |Description
|*sfdc:config-with-oauth* |Use to configure a connection to your Salesforce account via OAuth.
|===

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Description |Required? |Default Value
|*name* |Define a name to this configuration so it can later be referenced. |X | 
|*onNoToken* |Defines the behavior of a connector when a user with no OAuth token attempts to utilize the service. Possible values are EXCEPTION and STOP_FLOW.   |X |EXCEPTION
|*assignmentRuleId* |The ID of a specific assignment rule to run for the Case or Lead. The assignment rule can be active or inactive. The ID can be retrieved by querying the AssignmentRule object. If specified, do not specify useDefaultRule. This element is ignored for accounts, because all territory assignment rules are applied. If the value is not in the correct ID format (15-character or 18-character Salesforce ID), the call fails and a MALFORMED_ID exception is returned. |  | 
|*consumerKey* |Your application's client identifier (consumer key in Remote Access Detail). |X | 
|*consumerSecret* |Your application's client secret (consumer secret in Remote Access Detail). |X | 
|*timeObjectStore-ref* |The object store instance that should be used by the getUpdatedObjects() operation. If undefined, the connector will use the Mule default user object store. |  | 
|*clientId* |Client ID for partners. |  | 
|*batchSobjectMaxDepth* |Creating a batch creates sObjects using this value for the MAX_DEPTH check. |  | 
|*useDefaultRule* a|
If true for a Case or a Lead, the connector uses the default (active) assignment rule. If true for an Account, all territory assignment rules are applied; if false for an Account, no territory rules are assigned.

If you set this attribute to true, do not specify an assignmentRuleId.

 |  |false
|*allowFieldTruncationSupport* a|
If true, the connector truncates field values that are too long, which is the behavior in API versions 14.0 and earlier.

If false (default), no change in behavior. If a string or textarea value is too large, the operation fails with the fault code STRING_TOO_LONG.

 |  |false
|===

==== Customizing the Callback URL

OAuth requires a callback configuration. Salesforce automatically calls the callback endpoint once the user is authenticated and he or she grants authorization to the connector to access his or her private information.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Child Element |Description
|*sfdc:oauth-callback-config* |Use to configure the callback URL.
|===

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|====
|Attribute |Description |Required? |Default Value
|*domain* |The domain of the endpoint on which your OAuth callback is hosted.  When in production, this is the domain on which your application is hosted. |X | 
|*localPort* |The port on which your authorization flow is hosted. This is the port on which your HTTP endpoint is hosted. |X | 
|*remotePort* |The port of the endpoint at which your OAuth callback is hosted. |  | 
|*path* |The path of the endpoint at which your OAuth callback is hosted. |  | 
|*connector-ref* |References a global HTTP connector from which the sfdc:oauth-callback-config element borrows configuration details. If specified, then the sfdc:oauth-callback-config uses the referenced connector. |  | 
|*defaultAccessTokenId* |Mule uses this value to name an object store variable in which to store the Token ID. You can set this attribute to an expression to avoid overwriting the Token ID if multiple users access the same account. |  | 
|*async* |Determines whether the callback executes synchronously (default) or asynchronously. |  |false
|====

Example:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sfdc:oauth-callback-config domain="localhost" localPort="8081" remotePort="8081" path="oauthcallback"/>
----

==== Customizing the Object Store

The Salesforce connector can automatically save and restore access tokens. The connector stores the acquired access tokens, refresh tokens, and any other pertinent information in either the default user object store or a user-defined object store using the access token identifier as the key.

To configure an existing user-defined object store, include an **sfdc:object-store-config** in your application and configure an **objectStore-ref** attribute to reference the name of your existing object store. Use this configuration if you already have an object store configured that you would prefer to use for the persistence of your access and refresh tokens.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|======
|Optional Child Element |Description
|*sfdc:oauth-store-config* |Use to define a custom object store to persist access and refresh tokens.
|======

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|======
|Attribute |Description |Required? |Default Value
|*objectStore-ref* |The name of the object store to which you wish to persist access and refresh tokens. |X | 
|======

==== Configuring the Authorization Flow

Every Salesforce connector configured to use OAuth has an extra attribute called *accessTokenId*, which is an identification of the user authorizing the connector. In order to obtain an access token identification, you need to first call the *authorize* operation in a separate authorization flow. This flow must consist of an HTTP inbound endpoint and the *sfdc:authorize* element, as shown.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="authorizationAndAuthenticationFlow">
        <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="oauth-authorize"/>
        <sfdc:authorize/>
    </flow>
----

The sfdc:authorize element supports the following attributes.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Description |Required? |Default Value
|*display* a|
Use to tailor the login page to the user's device type. Valid values are:

* page—Full-page authorization screen. This is the default value if none is specified.
* popup—Compact dialog optimized for modern Web browser popup windows.
* touch—Mobile-optimized dialog.
* mobile—Mobile-optimized dialog for smartphones that don’t support touch screens.

 |X |page
|*immediate* a|
Determines whether the user should be prompted for login and approval.

* If set to true, and if the user is currently logged in and has previously approved the application, the approval step is skipped.
* If set to true and the user is not logged in or has not previously approved the application, the session is immediately terminated with the immediate_unsuccessful error code.

 |  |false
|*prompt* |Specifies how the authorization server prompts the user for reauthentication and reapproval. |  | 
|*authorizationUrl* |The URL to which the resource owner redirects to grant authorization to the connector. |  |+https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize+
|*accessTokenUrl* |The URL at which the user can obtain an access token. |  |+https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token+
|===

Calling this inbound endpoint via a browser initiates the OAuth dance, redirecting the user to the Salesforce authorization page and creating a callback endpoint so Salesforce can call back once the user has authenticated and properly authorized the connector.  Once the callback gets called, the connector automatically issues an access token identifier that Mule saves with the key *OAuthAccessTokenId*. The connector automatically sets the OAuthAccessTokenId as a flow variable that is available to all message processors after the authorize call has completed. All Salesforce connector operations after the authorize flow require an *accessTokenId* as a parameter of the operation. Specify the expression  `#[flowVars.OAuthAccessTokenId]` , as shown in the following example, to supply this parameter. 

[source, xml, linenums]
----
...
<sfdc:query config-ref="mySalesforceConfig" query="SELECT Id FROM Account" accessTokenId="#[flowVars.OAuthAccessTokenId]"/>
...
----

== Operations

The following operations define the interaction you wish to perform via the Salesforce SOAP API, REST API, Bulk API, or Streaming API. Note that the Salesforce connector does not expose all possible operations of these Salesforce APIs. The selected operations below also have, in some cases, been modified from the bare minimum of the corresponding API call to change the return type. Refer to the Return Type Description column for more information.
