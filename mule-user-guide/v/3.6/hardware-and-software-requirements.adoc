= Hardware and Software Requirements
:keywords: mule, requirements, os, jdk, jre, java, compatibility, software, hardware, operating system

This page lists the hardware, operating systems, JREs, and other requirements to run Mule, the API Gateway Runtime, Mule Management Console, and Anypoint Studio.

== Mule

=== Hardware Requirements

* 2GHz CPU or 1 virtual CPU in virtualized environments
* 1GB of RAM
* 4GB of storage

This hardware requirements list is a recommendation and a starting point. Different applications have different requirements for the amount of latency (and thus raw CPU power) or the size and number of simultaneous messages that applications need to process (which in turn determines the amount of available memory Mule needs).

=== Software Requirements

==== Java Runtime Environments (JREs)

NOTE: After installing a JRE or JDK, install the link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html[Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) 7] unlimited strength jurisdiction policy files.

For Mule Runtime 3.6.0 or newer:

* Oracle Java 1.7.0_60 or newer
* IBM version 1.7

NOTE: Java 6 and Java 8 are not supported in Mule 3.6

==== Operating Systems

Mule runs on any operating system supported by the above JREs. To ensure this, every Mule release is validated against specific versions of the most widely used operating systems. 

The operating systems MuleSoft used to validate the current release are:

* Windows (32- and 64-bit) 2003, 2008, Windows 7, Windows 2012
* Mac OS 10.7, 10.8
* Linux RHEL (64-bit) 5.3, 6.1
* Ubuntu Server 12.04 (64-bit) *&#8224;*
* Solaris OS 10
* HP-UX 11i V3
* AIX V7.1

Because the only mandatory requirement for Mule is Java, Mule should also run on any newer versions of the tested operating systems in the above list, as well as any other operating systems supported by the JREs.

This hardware requirements list is a recommendation and a starting point. Different applications have different requirements for the amount of latency (and thus raw CPU power) or the size and number of simultaneous messages that applications need to process (which in turn determines the amount of RAM Mule needs). 

*&#8224;* If you use SSL, MuleSoft recommends installing Ubuntu Server 12.14 (64-bit) instead of 12.04.

==== Application Servers

The current release of Mule supports the following application servers:

* Eclipse Jetty 8
* JBoss 6.1 (Enterprise)
* JBoss 7 (Community)
* Apache Tomcat 7
* IBM WebSphere 8
* Oracle WebLogic 12c

Additionally, users have reported success deploying Mule with the following application servers:

* Geronimo

==== Java Virtual Machines

The current release of Mule supports the following Java Virtual Machines:

* Oracle Hot Spot 6
* Oracle Hot Spot 7
* IBM JVM 6

==== Messaging Platforms

The current release of Mule supports the following messaging platforms:

* Apache ActiveMQ 5.9.0
* IBM WebSphere MQ 7
* Oracle AQ

Additionally, users have reported successful integration using the following messaging platforms:

* Open MQ
* TIBCO EMS
* TIBCO Rendezvous
* Hornet MQ

==== Database Servers

The current release of Mule supports the following database servers:

* Oracle Database11g
* Microsoft SQL Server 2012
* MySQL 5.5
* IBM DB2 10.1
* PostgreSQL 9.6
* Apache Derby 10.9.1.0

== API Gateway Runtime

=== Hardware Requirements

* 2GHz, dual-core CPU, or 2 virtual CPUs in virtualized environments
* 2GB of RAM
* 4GB of storage

This hardware requirements list is a recommendation and a starting point. Different applications have different requirements for the amount of latency (and thus raw CPU power) or the size and number of simultaneous messages that applications need to process (which in turn determines the amount of RAM the API Gateway Runtime needs).

=== Software Requirements

==== Java Runtime Environments

NOTE: After installing a JRE or JDK, install the link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html[Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) 7] unlimited strength jurisdiction policy files.

* Oracle Java 1.7

==== Operating Systems

*The API Gateway Runtime runs on any operating system supported by the above JRE.* To ensure this, every API Gateway release is validated against specific versions of the most widely used operating systems. 

The operating systems MuleSoft used to validate the current release are:

* Windows (32- and 64-bit) 2003, 2008, Windows 7, Windows 2012
* Mac OS 10.7, 10.8
* Linux RHEL (64-bit) 5.3, 6.1
* Ubuntu Server 12.04 (64-bit)**
* Solaris OS 10
* HP-UX 11i V3
* AIX V7.1

** If you use SSL, MuleSoft recommends installing Ubuntu Server 12.14 (64-bit) instead of 12.04.

Because the only mandatory requirement for the API Gateway Runtime is Java, the API Gateway should also run on any newer versions of the tested operating systems in the above list, as well as any other operating systems supported by the JRE.


== Mule Management Console

=== Hardware Requirements

* 2GHz CPU
* 4 GB of RAM
* 10 GB of storage

This hardware requirements list is a recommendation and a starting point. Different applications have different requirements for the amount of latency (and thus raw CPU power) or the size and number of simultaneous messages that applications need to process (which in turn determines the amount of RAM MMC needs).

=== Software Requirements

==== Java Runtime Environments

NOTE: After installing a JRE or JDK, install the link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html[Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) 7] unlimited strength jurisdiction policy files.

* Oracle Java 1.7

==== Web Application Servers

* JBoss 6 or 6.1
* Tomcat 6.x or 7.x
* WebSphere Application Server 7.0 and 8.0

==== Operating Systems

Mule Management Console runs on any operating system supported by one of the above web application servers.

==== Browsers

* Firefox (latest version)
* Chrome (latest version)
* Safari (latest version)
* Internet Explorer 9 or newer

*** We strongly recommend running Mule Management Console on a separate server from the hardware that runs Mule.
