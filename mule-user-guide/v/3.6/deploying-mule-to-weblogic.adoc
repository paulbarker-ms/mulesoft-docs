= Deploying Mule to WebLogic
:keywords: deploy, deploying, weblogic

These instructions assume you have downloaded and installed WebLogic Application Server version 10.3. Note that WebLogic 8.x and 9.x are also supported, but these instructions are specific to version 10.3 of Oracle WebLogic.

*Note:* For an example of Mule running in a webapp under WebLogic, take the webapp example from the standalone distribution and make the changes described above.

== Deploying a web application with Mule in WebLogic

Carry out the following steps, explained in detail below:

. Create a WAR file with your application.
. _Required._ Modify your <<Modify your WebLogic Configuration>> by adding elements to the *weblogic.xml* file.
. Configure logging as described in <<Configuring Logging>>.

=== Create a WAR File

Before you deploy your Mule application to WebLogic, you must prepare it as a web application. This involves creating a `web.xml` file for your Mule application, a `weblogic.xml` file for configuring the server, and  creating a `.war` file of all the supporting files.

The `web.xml` file configures the Mule application as a web application by specifying your Mule configuration file and other options for starting Mule in the WebSphere container. Create a `web.xml` file for your Mule application as per the example below.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app id="WebApp_ID" version"2.4">
  <!--Mule configuration (Mule format)-->
  <context-param>
    <param-name>org.mule.config</param-name>
    <param-value>mule-config.xml</param-value>
  </context-param>
  <listener>
    <listener-class>org.mule.config.builders.MuleXmlBuilderContextListener</listener-class>
  </listener>
  <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>muleServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/app-path/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
  <!--Mule configuration ends-->
</web-app>
----

=== Modify your WebLogic Configuration

Include these lines in the *weblogic.xml* file to prioritize Mule libraries:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<container-descriptor>
   <prefer-web-inf-classes>true</prefer-web-inf-classes>
</container-descriptor> 
----

Instead, for a more fine-grained package overriding, you can refer to individual packages as shown below:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<container-descriptor>
   <prefer-application-packages>
      <package-name>org/apache/commons/lang</package-name>
   </prefer-application-packages>
</container-descriptor>
----

=== Configuring Logging

Mule uses link:http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html[Log4j2]. WebLogic can be configured so that WebLogic's and Mule's logging both use log4j.

. Copy `<WLHOME>/wlserver_10.3/server/lib/wllog4j.jar` to `<WLHome>/user_projects/domains/<yourdomain>/lib`.
. link:http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/download.html[Download] the Log4j logging file.
. Unzip the file and copy `log4j.jar` to `<WLHome>/user_projects/domains/<yourdomain>/lib`.
. link:http://commons.apache.org/downloads/download_logging.cgi[Download] the Commons logging file.
. Unzip the file and copy `commons-loggin.jar` to `<WLHome>/user_projects/domains/<yourdomain>/lib`.
. Launch your WebLogic domain and log into the console.
. In the left navigation pane, expand *Environment* and select *Servers*.
. In the Servers table, click the name of the server instance whose logging you want to configure.
. Select *Logging* > *General*, and click *Advanced* at the bottom of the page.
. In the Logging Implementation list box, select *Log4j*.
. Click *Save*.
. Restart your WebLogic domain to activate the changes.

== Deploying Mule

These instructions demonstrate the deployment through the Administration console. Note that this section also applies when deploying an EAR or WAR that embeds Mule to WebLogic, in which case you deploy the EAR or a WAR.

==== Deploying Mule Using the Administration Console

To deploy Mule from the Administration console:

. Start the WebLogic server. For example, in Windows choose *Start* > *BEA Products* > *WebLogic Server*.
. Start the Admin Server for your domain. For example, on Windows you would choose *Start* > *BEA Products* > * User Projects* > *<yourdomain>* > *Start Admin Server for WebLogic Server Domain*.
. When prompted, log in to the console using the user name and password you specified when creating the domain. If you close the console and need to restart it later, you can go to the URL `http://localhost:7001/console/console.portal`.
. In the Domain Structure on the left, click *Deployments*.
. Click *Install*, and then navigate to the location where you downloaded the web application EAR file.
. Select the EAR file and click *Next*.
. Select *Install this deployment as an application*
. Select *Next*.
. Select *Finish*.
. In the Change Center on the left, click *Activate Change*.
