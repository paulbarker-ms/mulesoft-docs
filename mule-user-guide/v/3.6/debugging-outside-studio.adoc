= Debugging Outside Studio
:keywords: debugging, debug

In Anypoint Studio, you can use the link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/studio-visual-debugger[Studio Visual Debugger] to help you troubleshoot your app. If you're creating your Mule app outside Studio, you can resort to the following options:

== When Running From Eclipse

Select the "Debug As > Mule Server" start-up mode from your configuration file. Any breakpoint you will have set in your custom code or Mule's source code will suspend the execution and will take you to Eclipse's Debug perspective.

== When Running Mule Standalone

You need to start Mule with the -debug to activate remote debugging, which gives (on Linux):

[source, code, linenums]
----
$MULE_HOME/bin/mule -debug
----

With this option, Mule will start normally with the only difference being the following message logged in the console:

[source, code, linenums]
----
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005
----

Mule is now remote debuggable on port 5005. Should you want to use another port or configure the JVM to ponder until a remote debugger gets attached, edit the mule start-up script that is relevant for your operating system and change the parameters found in the JPDA_OPTS property.

Switch to Eclipse and go the the *Run > Debug Configurations* menu. From there, create a *Remote Java Application* configuration. Ensure the port is 5005.

Also, in order to step debug with the source code attached, you need to add the source code of your Mule local instance as an external archive on the second tab of the configuration panel.

Click the *Debug* button at the lower right corner of the configuration screen. The local Mule instance will resume its start-up sequence and soon you'll be ready to step debug.
