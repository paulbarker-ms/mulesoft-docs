*link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/about-the-xml-configuration-file[About the XML Configuration File]* +
The most common way to configure Mule is with Spring XML files that use custom Mule namespaces. +
Use one of the two namespaces in your spring framework schema in Mule:

* `+http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans+` `+http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-current.xsd+`
* `+http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans+` `+http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-current.xsd+`

*link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/spring-application-contexts[Spring Application Contexts]* +
Mule offers several options for creating and managing Spring application contexts for your application.

* Single application context
* Multiple application context
* Existing application context
* Existing application context as parent

*link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/using-spring-beans-as-flow-components[Using Spring Beans as Flow Components]* +
Build Spring beans to define component behaviors which Mule applications can reference.

*Spring Bean Definition Profiles* +
Muleâ€™s configuration file takes advantage of the ability in Spring 3.1 and later to create *bean definition profiles*. You can use Spring bean definition profiles to register different beans for different target environments, instead of using one bean for all target environments. Refer to link:http://blog.springsource.org/2011/02/11/spring-framework-3-1-m1-released/[Spring 3.1 blog posting] for more information about bean definition profiles.
