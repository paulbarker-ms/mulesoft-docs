= Until Successful Scope

The **until-successful** scope processes messages through the processors within its scope until the operation succeeds. Until-successful's processing occurs asynchronously from the main flow. After passing a message into the until-successful scope, the main flow immediately regains control of the thread.

Until-successful repeatedly retries to process a message which is attempting to complete an activity such as:

* dispatching to outbound endpoints, for example, when calling a remote web service that may have availability issues
* executing a component method, for example, when executing on a Spring bean that may depend on unreliable resources
* executing a subflow

<until-successful objectStore-ref="objectStore" maxRetries="5" secondsBetweenRetries="60" doc:name="Until Successful">

== Success and Failure

As this scope continues to processes messages until successful, it is important to understand the definition of successful in context of Mule message processing.

[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|FAILURE |A message processor within the until-successful scope throws an exception.
|SUCCESS |A message processor within the until-successful scope does not return a message (i.e. is a one-way endpoint)
|_conditional_ |Where you have configured a failure expression (see below), Mule evaluates the return message against the expression to dynamically determine if the action has failed or succeeded.
|FAILURE |A message processor within the until-successful scope contains an exception payload.
|SUCCESS |A message processor within the until-successful scope _does not_ contain an exception payload.

=== Configuring failureExpression

The following illustrates how to configure the `failureExpression` on an until-successful scope:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<until-successful objectStore-ref="objectStore"
                  failureExpression="#[header:INBOUND:http.status != 202]"
                  maxRetries="6"
                  secondsBetweenRetries="600">
    <http:outbound-endpoint address="http://acme.com/api/flakey"
                            exchange-pattern="request-response"
                            method="POST" />
</until-successful>
----

=== Configuring a Dead Letter Queue

To manage messages which have exhausted the number of `maxRetries` within the until-successful scope, you can define a DLQ (dead letter queue) endpoint to which Mule can send such messages. Refer to the code sample below for an example configuration.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<until-successful objectStore-ref="objectStore"
                  deadLetterQueue-ref="dlqChannel"
                  maxRetries="3"
                  secondsBetweenRetries="10">
...
</until-successful>

== Until-Successful and Object Store

This message processor needs an http://www.mulesoft.org/docs/site/3.2.0-SNAPSHOT/apidocs/index.html?org/mule/api/store/ListableObjectStore.html[ListableObjectStore] instance in order to persist messages pending (re)processing. There are several implementations available in Mule, including the following:

* DefaultInMemoryObjectStore: default in-memory store
* DefaultPersistentObjectStore: default persistent store
* FileObjectStore: file-based store
* QueuePersistenceObjectStore: global queue store
* SimpleMemoryObjectStore: in-memory store

See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/mule-object-stores[Mule Object Stores] for further information about object stores in Mule. The following code sample illustrates how to configure an in-memory store:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<spring:bean id="objectStore" class="org.mule.util.store.SimpleMemoryObjectStore" />
