= Mule Filter Processor

Generally positioned immediately after an inbound endpoint in a Mule flow, the *Mule Filter Processor* evaluates two message properties, then rejects the message if the values fall outside of its configured parameters. The properties that are evaluated are:

* *IP address* – If the IP address of a message falls outside the filter’s configured IP address range, Mule does not process the message (see image below).
* *Creation timestamps* — Where the message’s creation date and time fall outside the filter’s configured acceptable lifespan (i.e. the message is older than expected), Mule does not process the message (see image below).

== Configuring the Mule Filter Processor

Use a Mule Filter Processor to protect a network, database, or system from unauthorized access by users outside the network. In other words, use a filter to exclude users from non-authorized IP addresses from accessing your system.

Further, use a security filter to protect your resource against a replay attack. By rejecting messages with a lifespan that exceeds a short timeframe — 30 seconds, for example — Mule protects your application from processing the same message a user maliciously sends multiple times. To be effective, a Mule flow should employ a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/mule-digital-signature-processor[digital signature], in addition to this type of security filter, to sign the creation time of the message.

The following steps describe how to configure the Mule Filter Processor to filter by IP address range.

. Add a global **Filter **Element to your application, apply a unique Name to the element, the only attribute to configure.
. Place a Filter message processor in your flow, typically positioned after an inbound endpoint, such as HTTP, so as to filter out invalid messages early in the flow.
. Configure the message processor according to the table below.

== Filter Strategies

The Mule Filter processor allows you to filter messages according to the following four filter strategies:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Operation |Description |Example
|*Filter by IP* |Type an IP address or regular expression to define the address or range from which the Filter will accept connections. |**Regex:** `192.168.1.10`, `192.168.1.*` (to allow the range from 1.0 to 1.254)
|*Filter by IP range* |Enter a net address and mask to determine the IP range. The IP addresses or ranges you enter will be considered valid, and allowed by the Filter. a|
*Net:* `192.168.1.0`

*Mask:* `255.255.255.0`

|*Filter by IP range CIDR* |Enter the desired IP range in CIDR notation. |**Cidr:**`192.168.1.0/24`
|*Filter expired* a|
This option allows you to define an expiration time for the message.

* To define an expiration time based upon the time a message entered the flow, enter a Mule Expression to call a variable that provides this date and time in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601] format (yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ssZ), and an expiration time in milliseconds. (Earlier in the flow, you will need to name and define this variable so that it extracts the date and time information from your message's metadata.) The expiration time will be calculated based on the timestamp extracted from the message, and the filter will discard messages received after that expiration time.
* To define an exact date and time after which messages should expire, enter a date and time in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601] format (yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ssZ), and an expiration time in milliseconds. The expiration time is calculated from the precise date and time you enter, and the filter will discard messages received after that expiration time.
