= Configuring Properties

This page describes configuring properties, such as property placeholders and system properties.

== Property Placeholders

You can use Ant-style property placeholders in your Mule ESB configuration. For example:

The values for these placeholders can be made available in a variety of ways, as described in the sections below.

== Global Properties

You can use the `<global-property>` element to set a placeholder value from within your Mule configuration, such as from within another Mule configuration file:

== Properties Files

To load properties from a file, you can use the standard Spring element +
 `<context:property-placeholder>`:

where the contents of `smtp.properties` is:

To load multiple properties files, separate them with commas:

== Message Properties

You can use placeholders to perform logic on message properties such as the header. For example, if you wanted to evaluate the content-type portion of the message header, you would specify it as `#[message.inboundProperties['Content-Type']]`. Typically, you use message property placeholders with expressions. For more information, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/mule-expression-language-mel[Mule Expression Language MEL].

== System Properties

The placeholder value can come from a JDK system property. If you start Mule from the command line, you would specify the properties as follows:

or edit the system properties in `conf/wrapper.conf` if you are deploying Mule as a webapp. When running Mule in a container, as of Mule 2.2.2 you can also specify the server ID in the `web.xml` file as follows:

If you start Mule programmatically, you would specify the properties as follows before creating and starting the Mule context:

There are also several system properties that are immutable after startup. To set these, you customize the `MuleConfiguration` using the set method for the property (such as `setId` for the system ID), create a `MuleContextBuilder`, load the configuration to the builder, and then create the context from the builder.

For example:

For information on the set methods you can use to set system properties, see:

For information on configuration builders, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/about-configuration-builders[About Configuration Builders].

== Environment Variables

There are several ways to access environment variables, but there is no standard way.
