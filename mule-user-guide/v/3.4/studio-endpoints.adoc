= Studio Endpoints

Endpoints pass messages into and out of a Mule flow, usually to external resources such as databases, Web clients, or email servers, but they can exchange messages with other Mule flows as well. Specific endpoints such as HTTP, JMS, and WMQ each use a specific channel (i.e., transport protocol) to transfer messages.

=== About Inbound Endpoints

An *Inbound Endpoint*, which resides at the beginning of a flow and acts as a *Message Source*, triggers a new flow instance each time it receives a message.

image:InboundEndpointExample.png[InboundEndpointExample]

Each incoming message must arrive on the specific transport channel supported by the receiving endpoint. For example, email can arrive on a POP3 or IMAP inbound endpoint, but files must use the FTP, File, or SFTP endpoints.

==== Moving Inbound Endpoints

*Version 3.3.1 only*: Moving an inbound endpoint within a flow changes its exchange pattern. When you click to drag an inbound endpoint to a new location, Mule displays a pop-up dialogue to advise that it is automatically converting the endpoint from inbound to outbound.

==== About Composite Sources

A special Studio building block typically placed at the beginning of a flow and known as a *Composite Source Scope* allows you to encapsulate two or more endpoints that receive the same type of data (e.g., email, files, database maps, or HTML) into a single message processing block. Each embedded endpoint listens on its specific channel for incoming messages. Whichever endpoint receives a message first becomes the message source for that particular instance of the flow.

Drag the Composite Source Scope onto the Message Flow canvas from the Studio Palette, then drag the endpoints into the Composite Source Scope processing block. The composite source then allows the each embedded endpoint to act as a temporary, non-exclusive message source when it receives an incoming message.

=== About Outbound Endpoints

If an endpoint is not the first building block (i.e., the message source) in a flow, it is designated as an *Outbound Endpoint*, since it uses the specific transport channel it supports (such as SMTP, HTTP, or JDBC) to dispatch messages to targets outside the flow, which can range from file systems to email servers to Web clients and can also include other Mule flows.

In many cases, an *Outbound Endpoint* completes a flow by dispatching a fully processed message to its final, external destination. However, Outbound Endpoints don't always complete flow processing, because they can also exist in the middle of a flow, dispatching data to an external source, and also passing that (or some other data) to the next message processor in the flow.

==== Moving Outbound Endpoints

*Version 3.3.1 only*: If you move the endpoint to the beginning of a flow, Mule does not automatically convert the endpoint from outbound to inbound. In such a case, right click the outbound endpoint, then select *Convert to an inbound endpoint* to manually change its exchange pattern.

=== About Request-Response Endpoints

Some endpoints, when set to a **request-response exchange pattern**, become "hybrid" endpoints which both accept incoming messages (thus acting as message sources or inbound endpoints), and dispatch processed message results back to their original senders (thus acting as outbound endpoints). Furthermore, request-response endpoints can, under specific circumstances, appear at the beginning, middle, or end of a flow.

== Configuration

The pre-packaged endpoints that ship with Studio require little configuration, except for context-specific values. Wherever practical, Studio provides default values that you can override, as necessary. Studio also bundles all required code resources for specific endpoints.

Endpoint configuration consists of two stages:

. Position the endpoint within the flow on the Message Flow canvas.
. Configure a number of context-specific values through the Endpoint’s graphical *Properties* pane, which you open by double-clicking the endpoint icon.

When you create certain endpoints (Ajax, JDBC, JMS, SMTP, and File), you must create a corresponding Global Connector.

While unique properties exist for various endpoints, most of these building blocks share common properties.

The endpoint Properties panes shown throughout this page are typical, but not definitive for all situations. Keep in mind at all times that specific endpoint property panes and individual property fields vary depending on the type of endpoint _and_ how that endpoint is used within a flow.

=== The General Tab

image:HTTPEndpointGen.png[HTTPEndpointGen]

Typically, the *General* tab provides fields for the following:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Description
|*Display Name* |Defaults to the generic endpoint name. Change the display name, which must be alpha-numeric, to reflect the endpoint's specific role, e.g., `Order Entry Endpoint`
|*Exchange-Pattern* |Defines the interaction between the client and server. The available patterns are *one-way* and **request-response**. A one-way exchange-pattern assumes that no response from the server is necessary, while a request-response exchange-pattern waits for the server to respond before it allows message processing to continue.
|*Enable HTTPS* |Activates SSL for the endpoint. Check the box to enable SSL security.
|*Host* |The default name is `localhost`. Enter the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or IP address of the server.
|*Port* |The port number used to connect to the server. (e.g., 80)
|*Path* |Allows connection to the server using a path instead of a username and password. e.g., /enter/the/path
|===

Depending on the Endpoint type (inbound or outbound); these additional parameters may appear on the General tab:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|=====
|Property |Description
|*Polling Frequency* |Time is milliseconds (ms) to check for incoming messages. Default value is *1000* ms.
|*Output Pattern* |Choose the pattern from a drop down list. Used when writing parsed filenames to disk.
|*FTP Settings* |Check *Binary* to enable binary file transport. Check *Passive* to enable passive protocol. Use passive protocol if the client is behind a firewall.
|*Query Key* |Enter the key of the query to use.
|*Transaction* |Lets you select the element to use for a transaction. Use the plus image:add.png[(plus)] button to add Mule transactions.
|*Cron Information* |Enter a `cron expression` to schedule events by date and time.
|*Method* |The operation performed on message data. Available options are: **OPTION, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, TRACE, CONNECT and DELETE**.
|=====

=== The Advanced Tab

For most endpoints, the *Advanced* tab includes the following generic properties:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Description
|*Address* |Enter the URL address. If using this attribute, include it as part of the URI.
|*Response Timeout* |How long the endpoint waits for a response (in ms).
|*Encoding* |Select the character set the transport will use. e.g., UTF-8
|*Disable Transport Transformer* |Check this box if you do not want to use the endpoint’s default response transport.
|*MIME Type* |Select a format from the drop-down list that this endpoint supports.
|===

Depending on the endpoint type (inbound or outbound), these additional parameters may appear on the Advanced tab:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Description
|*Polling Frequency* |How often (in ms) the endpoint checks for incoming messages.
|*Identity File and Passphrase Information* |Enter PKI authentication information.
|*Follow Redirects* |If a request is made using GET that responds with a redirectLocation header, checking the box will make the request on the redirect URL. This only works when using GET.
|===

=== The References Tab

== Endpoint Components Available in Studio

Studio bundles more that two dozen endpoints, and the list continues to grow. Three of these are available only for Mule Enterprise Edition, and therefore, the icons are rendered with light (rather than dark) blue backgrounds, as illustrated in the following table:

[%header%autowidth.spread]

|====

=== Inbound and Outbound Endpoints

The endpoints in this list can be added to a flow as either an inbound or outbound endpoints. Inbound endpoints can be configured to receive message data from external sources, such as a web browser, while outbound endpoints can be set to send message data to an external party or to another building block in a flow for further processing.

The following table lists the exchange-pattern(s) supported by each endpoint. When an endpoint supports multiple exchange-patterns, the entry in *bold* represents the default exchange-pattern.

=== Inbound Only Endpoints

As their name implies, inbound-only endpoints can only consume messages; they cannot dispatch data to destinations outside the flow. For example, the POP3 and IMAP endpoints each receive messages from an email server.

The following table lists the exchange pattern(s) supported by each endpoint, with the default exchange pattern listed in *bold*.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
