= Deployment Descriptor

* <<Options>>
* <<Classloadling in Mule>>

Mule's deployment descriptor is a properties file (`mule-deploy.properties`) that controls how a Mule application should be deployed. A typical application, however, would rarely need to use many of the configuration properties available in the file, relying instead on defaults.

Mule checks if there is a deployment descriptor file in the application root and uses it if available (it's optional).

Here's the list of supported configuration properties in the deployment descriptor:

[%header,cols="34,33,33"]
|===
|Name |Description |Default
|domain |ClassLoader domain for this application. Typically used to share common libraries between applications and/or to allow use of different library version in applications. Maps directly to `$MULE_HOME/lib/shared/<domain>`. For example, `stockDomain` maps to `$MULE_HOME/lib/shared/stockDomain`. |"default"
|config.resources |A Mule 2.x-style comma separated list of configuration files for this application. Typical use is to support split configurations declaratively. An alternative is to have a default `mule-config.xml` file import extra configuration pieces. Note that the first config piece is considered to be a 'master' and is monitored for redeployment, but not others. |`mule-config.xml` from the app root is used if nothing else is specified
|redeployment.enabled |Allows explicitly disabling application hot-redeployment - configuration 'master' file will not be monitored for changes. Dropping a new version of the application archive in the `$MULE_HOME/apps` will still redeploy the application. Any values other than `true, yes, on` are treated as `false` and disable the config change monitor. |Enabled by default
|encoding |Default encoding, used throughout the application if none specified explicitly on, for example,. a transformer |UTF-8
|config.builder |Configuration builder to use for parsing the application config file. |AutoConfigurationBuilder
|scan.packages (since Mule 3.1) |The application's classpath is no longer scanned for iBeans annotations (`@Call`, `@Template` and `@IBeanGroup`). The regular Mule annotations (for example, `@Transformer` still work). To reactivate classpath scanning, configure a comma-separated list of package names to scan for annotations at startup. |Empty by default
|loader.override |Overrides default class loading. The property value is specified as a comma-separated list of classes, packages, or both. Blocking can also be specified by preceding the classes or packages in the list with a - (dash/minus sign). If a class is specified in the blocking list, its lookup is performed within the application or plugin only, and not in Mule. For further details, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/classloader-control-in-mule[Classloader Control in Mule]. |Empty by default
|===

Two things to note:

* Classloader domains can feature different versions of the same library for different sets of applications.
* Unless otherwise instructed, the default domain is used. You can specify a custom domain using the `domain` property in the application deployment descriptor.

== Options

An application may also contain a `mule-app.properties` file in the application root (right next to the `mule-deploy.properties` file). The `mule-app.properties` file is the place to put any custom properties for the application. Mule will make them available in the registry and they can be accessed in two ways:

* At application startup in the configuration file. Use a `${foo`} placeholder (or any Mule expression which can get to the registry) to lookup a `foo` value.
* In the code (for example, by implementing `MuleContextAware`). A registry ref is then accessible through `muleContext.getRegistry()`. You can then use any suitable lookup method on this instance.
