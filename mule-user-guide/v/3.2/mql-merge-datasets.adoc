= MQL Merging Datasets

If you've ever had two datasets which you need to merge into a common data format, you know that it can be a pain. (Ever used XSLT?) In this example, we take a look at what it takes to get two activity streams, http://twitter.com[Twitter] and http://yammer.com[Yammer], into a common format.

Here are some abbreviated snippets of each individual format:

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Twitter |Yammer
|

[source, code, linenums]
----
{    "coordinates": null,    "favorited": false,    "created_at": "Thu Jul 15 23:26:04 +0000 2010",    "truncated": false,    "text": "My Twitter message.",    "contributors": null,    "id": 18639444000,    "geo": null,    "in_reply_to_user_id": null,    "place": null,    "in_reply_to_screen_name": null,    "user": { ... }   }
----

[source, code, linenums]
----
 {      "client_url": "https://www.yammer.com/",      "created_at": "2011/03/28 20:39:12 +0000",      "system_message": false,      "body": {        "parsed": "Myyammer message.",        "plain": "My Yammer message."      },      "sender_type": "user",      "network_id": 104604,      "thread_id": 84402777,      "web_url": "https://www.yammer.com/yammerdeveloperstestcommunity/messages/84402777",      "direct_message": false,      "id": 84402777,      "url": "https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/84402777",      "client_type": "Web",      "message_type": "update",      "sender_id": 4022984,      "replied_to_id": null,      "attachments": ...,      "liked_by": ...,      "privacy": "public"    }
----
|===

Here is what we'd like to see instead:

[source, code, linenums]
----
[  { "text" : "My Twitter Message.", "source" : "twitter" },  { "text" : "My Yammer Message.", "source" : "yammer" }]
----

Given that there are Cloud Connectors for both of these, we can write two simple queries to get a timeline from each service and put them in the desired data format:

[source, code, linenums]
----
from yammer.messages select new { text = body.plain, source = 'yammer' }from twitter.publicTimeline as tweet select new { text = tweet.text, source = 'twitter' }
----

"yammer" and "twitter" can become variables that we can refer to by declaring them in our Mule application XML:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<twitter:config name="twitter"                 format="JSON"                 consumerKey="${twitter.consumer.key}"                 consumerSecret="${twitter.consumer.secret}"/>                          <yammer:config name="yammer"                consumerKey="${yammer.consumer.key}"                consumerSecret="${yammer.consumer.secret}"  />
----

Now, we can put this in a Mule which aggregates both data sets:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="get-activity">    <inbound-endpoint address="http://localhost:9002/activity" exchange-pattern="request-response"/>    <all>        <mql:transform query="from yammer.messages select new { text = body.plain }" />        <mql:transform query="from twitter.publicTimeline as tweet select new { text = tweet.text }" />    </all>    <combine-collections-transformer/>    <response>        <json:object-to-json-transformer/>    </response></flow>
----

Step by step, here is what this flow does:
. Listens for requests on http://localhost:9002/activity
. When a request comes in, do two queries - one to pull yammer messages and one to pull messages from the twitter public timeline. Each query transforms the result into the desired format.
. Combines the Lists of messages from Yammer and Twitter into a single list
. Returns the response as JSON objects

== Running the example

To run this example, you need to first register the application with Twitter and Yammer so you can use OAuth.

* link:http://twitter.com[Create a Twitter account]
* Register your application with Twitter.
* Record your OAuth consumer key and consumer secret.
* link:http://yammer.com[Create a Yammer account]
* Register your application with Yammer https://www.yammer.com/client_applications/new
* Record your OAuth consumer key and consumer secret.

Next, we'll configure and start the examples application:

* link:http://www.mulesoft.org/download-mule-esb-community-edition[Download Mule] and extract the distribution
* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/mql-download[Download MQL] and extract the distribution
* Copy the examples/mql-examples-0.9.zip file from the MQL distribution to MULE_HOME/apps
* Start Mule with your OAuth tokens:

[source, code, linenums]
----
 $ cd mule-standalone-3.1.2/bin$ ./mule -M-Dyammer.consumer.key=YAMMER_CONSUMER_KEY -M-Dyammer.consumer.secret=YAMMER_CONSUMER_SECRET \   -M-Dtwitter.consumer.key=TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY -M-Dtwitter.consumer.secret=TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET
----

Now, we need to perform OAuth authentication for Yammer:

* Go to http://localhost:9002/yammer/request-authorization in your browser
* After your browser redirects you to Yammer, click "Authorize" to authorize this application to talk to Yammer
* Take the code in the resulting page and enter the following URL in your browser: http://localhost:9002/yammer/set-oauth-verifier?verifier=CODE

Finally, retrieve the combined Yammer and Twitter activity streams:

[source, code, linenums]
----
 $ curl -v http://localhost:9002/activity
----
