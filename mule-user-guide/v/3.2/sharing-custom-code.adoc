= Sharing Custom Code

Besides all the common code that exists in a company, there are Mule specific programmatic artifacts that are worth considering sharing.

Let's name a few:

*Custom transformers - performing operations that none of the Mule stock transformers can perform (see: Creating Custom Transformers), +
 *Custom components - typically Mule-aware or non-business oriented components, as business components are usually simple POJOs coming from pre-existing projects (see: Developing Components), +
 *Custom expression evaluators - for the cases when a specific message extraction capacity is needed in several places of an application (see: Creating Expression Evaluators).

The most convenient way to share custom code across team is to rely on Maven's dependency management mechanism. Here is an extract of a pom.xml referring to common code stored in a shared Maven library:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.acme.mulings</groupId>
  <artifactId>common-mule-project</artifactId>
  <version>1.3</version>
</dependency>
----

The Mule build plug-in will automatically bundle these extra dependencies in the /lib directory of the deployable application. In this case, the common-mule-project-1.3.jar will be added to this directory at build time, ready to be deployed and made available to the application running on Mule.
