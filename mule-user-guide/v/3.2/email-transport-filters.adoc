Filters can be set on an endpoint to filter out any unwanted messages. The Email transport provides a couple of filters that can either be used directly or extended to implement custom filtering rules.

This is how you define the MailSubjectRegExFilter in your Mule configuration:

<message-property-filter pattern="to=barney@mule.org"/>
