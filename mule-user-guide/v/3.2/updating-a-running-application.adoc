= Updating a Running Application

Updating a running application means putting a ZIP file in the ./apps directory. Mule will automatically expand the ZIP file and launch the new application stored there. If the application already exists, Mule will shut down the current instance and load and launch the new one you just put in the ./apps directory.

If you are using the Enterprise Edition of Mule, you can use the link:/mule-management-console/v/3.2[Mule Management Console] to update a running application.
