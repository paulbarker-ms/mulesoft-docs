= Python Component Reference

== Overview

The Python component can be used to enhance web-based transaction systems and further extend the capabilities of web-based applications. As an example, you can write a custom script in Python for an application, save it in a separate file and then configure the Python component to reference the file. Or, after placing the Python component on the Studio canvas you can type in the script through the Python *Pattern Properties* pane. The Python script is generally executed at runtime (client-side request) and the custom logic embedded in the script could trigger an application to execute a database transaction, or modify your web-page interface. The Python component is very similar to Java, Groovy and Ruby components. +
Python also allows the developer to configure interceptors and alter the values or references of particular properties in a script. Interceptors are configured to provide additional services to a message as it flows through a component. For example, a developer can configure an interceptor to execute scheduling or logging of a particular event while a message is being processed. The Python component also includes a custom interceptor which allows you to configure settings for Spring elements. Use the *Advanced* tab to access *Script Properties*, then define the value and reference for a particular property in the script. +
When using Python, typing-in or appending a script to the component is the only configuration required.

== Configuration

If the application referencing Python expects a response, use a request-response endpoint to enable the Python component to communicate in a two-way fashion (See: *below*).

If Python is used to simply pass data to the client, the transaction is referred to as one-way. No response is required from the client (See: *below*).

=== General Tab

To configure the Python component, from the Message Flow canvas double-click the Python icon to open the *Pattern Properties* pane. Use the General tab to specify the file location of the script or simply type in the script on the script text window. The scripting engine is Python.

|Panel |Description
|*Display* |Defaults to the generic component name. Change the *Display Name*, which must be alpha-numeric, to reflect the component's specific role, i.e., `Welcome Page Python Script`.
|*Script* |Select one of the following ways to reference the script. +
 *Script Text*: Type the script the component will load directly into this space. +
 *Script File*: Enter the location of the script to be loaded by the component. The file can reside on the classpath or the local file system.

=== Advanced Tab

Use the *Advanced* tab to optionally configure interceptors and (depending on the interceptor) enter Spring values. You also have the option to specify script properties, which are key/value pairs used to alter or change properties in the script. See the [MULETEMP:Script Component Reference] page for information on using the advanced tab.

|Panel |Description
|*Interceptors Management* |Interceptors enable the developer to provide additional services to the component such as the ability to log transactions and the ability to log the time for each transaction. Use the *Add Custom Interceptor* to create a custom interceptor that can reference Spring objects. The Interceptor Stack enables you to bundle multiple interceptors. Use the *Interceptor Stack* to apply multiple interceptors on a Python component. The interceptors will be applied in the order defined in the stack.
|*Script Properties* |Configure these parameters to define your attribute keys and their associated values. This enables the Python component to quickly look up a value associated with a key.

=== Documentation tab

The *Documentation* tab lets you add optional descriptive documentation for the Python component. Each component has a *Documentation* tab and optional *Description* field.
