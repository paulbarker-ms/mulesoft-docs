== Operations: Lists and List Items API

Using the Lists and List Items API lets you create, retrieve, update, and delete SharePoint lists and list items.

=== Creating, Updating, and Deleting List Items

When creating or updating an item, specify the list ID. After you specify an ID, DataSense fetches the list's metadata and the object builder shows each field that can be completed:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sharepoint-2013:list-create config-ref="Sharepoint_2013" doc:name="Sharepoint 2013" baseTemplate="GENERIC_LIST" title="Title"> <sharepoint-2013:list ref="#[payload]"/> </sharepoint-2013:list-create>
----

Or define the attributes in the connector itself:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sharepoint-2013:list-create config-ref="Sharepoint_2013" doc:name="Sharepoint 2013" baseTemplate="GENERIC_LIST" title="Title"> <sharepoint-2013:list contentTypesEnabled="true" description="Description"/> </sharepoint-2013:list-create>
----

For retrieving and deleting lists, only the list ID is necessary:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sharepoint-2013:list-delete config-ref="Sharepoint_2013" doc:name="Sharepoint 2013" listId="8e306633-c600-40ab-80db-80f57968c0a1" />
----

=== Creating, Updating, and Deleting List Items

When creating or updating an item, specify a list ID. DataSense uses the list ID to fetch a list's metadata. The Object Builder provides the fields you need to complete.

image:MSSPObjectBuilder.png[MSSPObjectBuilder]

=== Querying List Items

Using the query builder:

On the left panel, every not hidden list appears. On the right panel, the fields of the selected list appear. If the field is a *Lookup Field*, the field type is either `SharepointListReference` or `SharepointListMultiValueReference`.
+
image:SPQueryBuilder.png[SPQueryBuilder]

If any of these fields are selected to be returned by the query, two types of return objects are available, depending on the value of the *Retrieve full objects for reference fields* checkbox:

* *not checked*: A summary object containing the reference object's ID and the reference object list's ID:
+
[source, code, linenums]
----
{
    "Title": "A title",
    "LookupFieldId": {
        "id": "1",
        "lookupListId": "aaaa-1111-bbbb-2222"
    },
    "MultiValueLookupFieldId": {
        "ids": [
            1,
            2,
            3
        ],
        "lookupListId": "cccc-3333-dddd-4444"
    }
}
----

This object can later be used in another connector to retrieve the referenced object together with a for each component:

image:MSSPListItemQuery.png[MSSPListItemQuery]

* *checked*: Retrieves the full object graph. In case there is a cycle, the summary reference object displays:
+
[source, code, linenums]
----
{
    "Title": "A title",
    "LookupFieldId": {
        "Title": "Another title",
        "Id": "1",
        "Property1": "A value"
    },
    "MultiValueLookupFieldId": [
        {
            "Title": "Another title",
            "Id": "1",
            "Property1": "A value"
        },
        {
            "Title": "Another title",
            "Id": "2",
            "Property1": "A value"
        }
    ]
}
----

Example *Query Text*:

image:SPExampleQText.png[SPExampleQText]

Checking this option may cause large item lists with many reference fields to take a long time to retrieve.

=== Working with Choice Column Type with Multiple Values

You can configure a Choice column type to allow multiple values. The metadata in Studio for columns accepting multiple values appears as follows:

image:SharePointChoiceMultiSelect.png[SharePointChoiceMultiSelect]

Assuming that the target List in SharePoint has a Title property and a multi-select column called ChoiceMultiSelect that accepts values `"one"`, `"two"`, or `"three"`, the following groovy script constructs a payload that sets the selection to `"one"`, `"three"`:

[source, code, linenums]
----
[Title: "foo", ChoiceMultiSelect: [results: ["one", "three"]]]
----

Any language that can construct a `List<string>` for the multi-select column results property may be used to similar effect.

== Operations: File and Folder API

Using the File and Folder API allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete files and folders, and also check in, check out, publish, approve, deny, copy, and recycle files from Documents Lists.

When using the folders operations, the server's relative URL refers to where the folder is or will be. The URL can be in the format `/site/docList/innerFolder` or in `docList/innerFolder` format. In the second case, the site specified in the connector's configuration site URL parameter is used.

When using the files operations, the file server relative url refers to a folder server relative URL plus the filename: `/site/docList/innerFolder/filename` or `docList/innerFolder/filename`.

=== Creating and Deleting a Folder

You can create or delete a folder by specifying the server relative URL where the folder is or where you plan to create the folder.

The resulting flow looks:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sharepoint-2013:folder-create config-ref="Sharepoint_2013" url="/path/to/folder" doc:name="Sharepoint 2013"/>
 
<sharepoint-2013:folder-delete config-ref="Sharepoint_2013" url="/path/to/folder" doc:name="Sharepoint 2013"/>
----

=== Adding a File

A file can be uploaded by selecting a physical file or passing an input stream to the connector, and it's uploaded to the specified server relative URL. For example, you can use this together with a File Connector to upload files to a list.

Using an input stream:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sharepoint-2013:file-add config-ref="Sharepoint_2013"
fileServerRelativeUrl="/path/to/folder/filename"
fileContentStream-ref="#[payload]" overwrite="true"
doc:name="Sharepoint 2013"/>
----

=== Getting File Contents

The file content is returned as a byte array. For example, you can use this as an input of a File Connector to download files from a list:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sharepoint-2013:file-get-content config-ref="Sharepoint_2013"
doc:name="Sharepoint 2013"
fileServerRelativeUrl="/path/to/folder/filename"/>
----

=== Querying Files and Folders

This operation returns all the files and folders that match the specified criteria, starting from the specified folder.

Using the query builder:

* On the left panel, a document list from the SharePoint instance appears. The selected instance is used as part of the starting path to query the files and folders.
* On the right panel, for every document list, the same fields appear.
* Additionally, you can specify an inner folder or folders in the Folder Path input, to use as the starting path.
* When selecting the recursive checkbox, files and folders are searched recursively in every folder of the starting path.

To set query builder options:

image:SharePointFolderPath.png[SharePointFolderPath]

Example:

[source, code, linenums]
----
sharepoint-2013:file-query config-ref="Sharepoint_2013" query="dsql:SELECT Author,ModifiedBy,Name,ServerRelativeUrl FROM #[header:inbound:documentListName]" recursive="true" doc:name="Sharepoint 2013"/>
 
<sharepoint-2013:folder-query config-ref="Sharepoint_2013" recursive="true" query="dsql:SELECT ItemCount,Name,ServerRelativeUrl FROM #[header:inbound:documentListName] WHERE ItemCount &gt; 0" doc:name="Sharepoint 2013"/>
----

=== Other File Operations

Approve, Check In, Check Out, Deny, Publish, Undo Checkout, and Unpublish, are all very similar to use. Specify the file URL, and in some, pass an additional comment as a parameter.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sharepoint-2013:file-publish config-ref="Sharepoint_2013" 
doc:name="Sharepoint 2013" fileServerRelativeUrl="" comment=""/>
----

=== Setting File Metadata

You can get and set metadata on files that are uploaded to Document Libraries by using the *Update List Item* operation.

To set the properties of the file in the list, you must know the *List Item Id*. This can be retrieved using the deferred *ListItemAllFields* property.

The following flow illustrates how a *File Add* may chain directly to an *Update List Item* operation to upload a file to a list and set the metadata immediately after:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="sharepoint_demo_fileAddWithMetadata"
   doc:name="sharepoint_demo_fileAddWithMetadata">
   <http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="request-response" host="localhost"
     port="8081" path="upload" doc:name="HTTP"/>
   <sharepoint:file-add config-ref="Sharepoint" 
     fileServerRelativeUrl="/Shared Documents/myfile.txt" 
     overwrite="true" 
     doc:name="Add file"/>
   <sharepoint:resolve-object config-ref="Sharepoint" 
     doc:name="Get ListItemId of File" 
     url="#[payload.listItemAllFields.__deferred.uri]"/>
   <sharepoint:list-item-update config-ref="Sharepoint" itemId="#[payload.Id]"
     listId="ccbfaf65-b53e-48ac-be19-adf45192ecc3" doc:name="Set file properties">
       <sharepoint:updated-properties>
           <sharepoint:updated-property key="Title">Test title</sharepoint:updated-property>
       </sharepoint:updated-properties>
   </sharepoint:list-item-update>
   <set-payload value="OK" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
</flow>
----


== Resolving Deferred Properties

For performance reasons, many SharePoint operations return a basic set of data for an entity along with one or more deferred property references you can use to retrieve additional detail or related objects.

You can use the generic *Resolve object* or *Resolve collection* operations to resolve the deferred property set to a single `Map<string,object>` or a `List<Map<string,object>>` and access this information in the flow.

For example, this technique gets the full set of fields of a SharePoint File object:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sharepoint:resolve-object config-ref="SharePoint" 
  url="#[payload.listItemAllFields.__deferred.url]" 
  doc:name="Microsoft SharePoint" >
</sharepoint:resolve-object>
----

Using the Mule Debugger or Logger component to log the payload, you can identify properties with a `__deferred` URL property.

== Exception Handling

=== Exception When Connecting

If the connector fails to connect with the SharePoint instance for any reason, an exception of type ConnectionException is thrown.

The exception message helps debug the cause of the exception.

=== Exception in Operations

If when executing an operation, an error occurs, then a SharepointException is thrown with a message about the error.
