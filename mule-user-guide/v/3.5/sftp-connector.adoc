= SFTP Connector

The SFTP Connector implements a secure file transport channel so that your Mule application can exchange files with external resources. SFTP uses the SSH security protocol to transfer messages. You can implement the SFTP endpoint as an inbound endpoint with a one-way exchange pattern, or as an outbound endpoint configured for either a one-way or request-response exchange pattern.

== Installation

You can install a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/installing-connectors[To Install a Connector from Anypoint Exchange].

== Configuration

SFTP endpoint configuration consists of two stages:

. Decide where you want to place the SFTP endpoint within your Mule flow, then drag it from the Palette to the appropriate place in the sequence of building blocks that make up your Mule flow.
.. If you place the SFTP endpoint at the beginning of the flow, it acts as an inbound endpoint (a message source), triggering the flow whenever it receives a message. (You can also use the *Composite Source* scope to wrap the SFTP endpoint along with other, similar endpoints (such as File or UDP) so that your flow can receive files through multiple transport channels).
.. If you place the SFTP building block in the middle or at the end of the flow, it serves as an outbound endpoint, passing information out of the flow to external resources.
+
SFTP Inbound Endpoints can only be set to a *one-way* exchange pattern. SFTP Outbound Endpoints can be set to either a one-way or *request-response* exchange pattern.
. Configure the SFTP endpoint by providing values for the fields on the various tabs on the properties editor, which you open by clicking the SFTP icon on the Message Flow canvas.

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Display Name* |Defaults to the generic endpoint name, which in this case is SFTP. Change the display name, which must be alpha-numeric, to reflect the endpoint's specific role, for example, `File Retrieval Endpoint.`
|*Exchange Pattern* |If set to one-way, an SFTP inbound or outbound endpoint sends the incoming message to the next building block in the flow. If an SFTP outbound endpoint is set to request-response (the SFTP inbound endpoint cannot be set to request-response), that outbound endpoint waits for a response before sending the message. *One-way* is the default for both the inbound and outbound SFTP endpoints.
|*Connector Configuration* |Use the dropdown list to select a previously configured connector configuration for this endpoint. If you have not created a connector configuration for this type of endpoint, you can do so from this window by clicking the green plus sign (*+*) Click the edit icon image:EditIcon.png[EditIcon] to modify a previously created global element.

|*Output Pattern* a|
_(Applies to outbound SFTP endpoint only.)_Specify a pattern for naming files that get sent from the File endpoint to the connected file system. If this is not set, the File endpoint uses the same file-naming pattern used for incoming files.

Example:

[source, code, linenums]
----
#[header:inbound:originalFilename]
----
|*Host* |Identify the outgoing (local) SFTP server, then supply user credentials for connecting to this server. Defaults to *localhost*. Enter the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or IP address of the server on your host machine that connects to the external SFTP server.
|*Port* |The port that connects to the local (host) server. (Normally, *22*)
|*Path* |Specify a path that facilitates connection to the local server so that you don’t have to provide a username and password.
|*User* |The username for authentication on the host server.
|*Password* |The password for authentication on the host server.

== General Tab - Global Element Properties Screens

After you click the Connector Configuration's green plus sign (*+*) or the edit symbol image:EditIcon.png[EditIcon], the Global Elements Properties screens appear with tabs for General, Advanced, Properties, Reconnection, File, and Notes. You can specify optional server property information or notes as needed. The rest of the screens are described in this section.

|Field |Description
|*Name* |Configuration name
|*Output Pattern* a|
_(Applies to outbound SFTP endpoint only.)_ Specify a pattern for naming files that get sent from the File endpoint to the connected file system. If not set, the File endpoint uses the same file-naming pattern used for incoming files.

Example:

[source, code, linenums]
----
#[header:inbound:originalFilename]
----

|*Identity File* |File location for the PKI private key file.
|*Passphrase* |Passphrase for the identity file (if needed).
|*Show password* |Set to make the characters in the Passphrase field visible.

|Field |Description
|*Dispatched Pool Fatctory* |Configures Bean properties.
|*Dynamic Notifications* |Indicate if you want dynamic email notifications.
|*Validate Connections* |Validate connections. Enabled by default.
|*Connection Pool Size* |Creates a connection pool size for one or more active connections. Specify a negative number for no limit of pool size, or set to zero (0) to indicate not to use a connection pool.
|*Polling Frequency* |Frequency in milliseconds to check the read directory. The read directory is specified by the endpoint of the listening component.
|*File Age* a|
Minimum age in milliseconds for Mule to wait before consuming a file. This allows a file write to complete before processing.

*Note*: The Mule server and the SFTP server must have synchronized time for file age to work correctly.

|*Size Check Wait Time* |Wait time in milliseconds between size checks to determine if a file is ready to be processed. This allows a file write to complete before processing. You can disable this feature by setting to a negative number or omitting a value. When enabled, Mule performs two size checks waiting the specified time between calls. If both checks return the same value, the file is ready to process.

|*Frequency (ms)* |The number of milliseconds that Mule should wait between attempting to re-establish an SFTP connection after a failure.
|*Reconnection Attempts* |The number of attempts Mule should make to re-establish an SFTP connection after a connection failure.
