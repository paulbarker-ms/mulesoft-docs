= Microsoft Dynamics CRM Connector

The Microsoft Dynamics Customer Relationship Management (CRM) connector lets you access Microsoft Dynamics CRM’s SOAP Organization Service. You can add this connector to an Anypoint Studio flow.

== Overview

This connector lets you perform the following operations:

* Create, update, and delete records
* Retrieve a single record or query multiple records
* Associate and disassociate records
* Execute a request message

This connector supports these Microsoft Dynamics CRM versions:

* Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 (on-premise)
* Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 (on-premise)
* Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online

Configuring the connector requires minimal parameters except for advanced use:

* Username and password for users granted access to CRM
* Organization Service URL - usually in the format:  +https://crm.mycompany.com/MyOrganization/XRMServices/2011/Organization.svc+

== Installation

== Running a Flow

. In Package Explorer, right click your project's name, and click *Run As > Mule Application*.

. Check the console to see when the application starts. You should see a message such as this example if no errors occur:
+
[source, code, linenums]
----
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Started app 'crm-demo'                                   +
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
----

. Open a browser and visit http://localhost:8081/query

The list of accounts display in descending order by name and in JSON format (results vary according to your CRM instance). For example:

[source, code, linenums]
----
[{"name":"Alpine Ski House (sample)","accountnumber":"ABCO9M32","accountid":"f5a917b4-7e06-e411-82a5-6c3be5a8ad64"},
{"name":"Adventure Works (sample)","accountnumber":"ABC28UU7","accountid":"eba917b4-7e06-e411-82a5-6c3be5a8ad64"}]

== CRM Authentication

=== Authentication Schemes

The Microsoft Dynamics CRM connector supports different authentication schemes based on the Microsoft Dynamics CRM that is accessed.

Supported authentication schemes for Microsoft Dynamics CRM on premise:

* Windows Authentication - Kerberos
* Windows Authentication – NTLM (requires Anypoint Gateway for Windows)
* Claims-based Authentication

Supported authentication schemes for Microsoft Dynamics CRM online:

* Live ID

Unsupported authentication schemes:

* Office 365 (not supported)

=== Advanced Kerberos Authentication

The preferred method to configure the connector for Kerberos authentication is to leverage auto-configuration. The prerequisites for setting *Automatically detect Kerberos configuration settings* are:

* Mule ESB server joined to the same domain as the CRM instance
* AD Domain Controller is accessible from the Mule ESB server

If Mule ESB does not automatically detect the Kerberos configuration settings, create a Kerberos configuration file and reference it in the connector's connection configuration.

Sample Kerberos configuration file:

[source, code, linenums]
----
[libdefaults]
default_realm = MYREALM.COM
[realms]
MYREALM.COM = {
    kdc = mydomaincontroller.myrealm.com
    default_domain = MYREALM.COM
}
[domain_realm]
.myrealm.com = MYREALM.COM
myrealm.com = MYREALM.COM
----

*Note*: The *default_realm* and *default_domain* values are case-sensitive. Specify these values exactly as defined in Active Directory. If you receive an error during Test Connection stating Message `stream modified (41)`, the domain name is not correctly formed.

More information on how to create the Kerberos configuration file can be found at http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-devel/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html.

To reference the Kerberos configuration file in a connector's connection configuration:

* Set the property *Kerberos Properties File Path*
* Place the file in the class path (usually under `src/main/resources`) and set the value of the property to *classpath:krb5.conf*
+
Or:
+
Provide the full path to the file as in *C:\kerberos\krb5.conf*

You can tune the Kerberos login module (Krb5LoginModule) with scenario-specific configurations by defining a JAAS login configuration file.

Example JAAS login configuration file for the Kerberos login module:

[source, code, linenums]
----
Kerberos {
    com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
    debug=true
    refreshKrb5Config=true;
};
----

For more information on how to create the JAAS login configuration file for the Kerberos login module, see [Class Krb5LoginModule].

To reference the JAAS login configuration file for the Kerberos login module in a connector's connection configuration:

. Set the property *Login Properties File Path*
. Place the file in the class path (usually under `src/main/resources`) and set the value of the property to *classpath:jaas.conf*
+
Or:
+
Provide the full path to the file as in C:\kerberos\jaas.conf

The Service Principal Name (SPN) can usually be automatically discovered from the Organization Service's WSDL. If the SPN cannot be discovered automatically, set the value in the connector's connection configuration SPN property.

The SPN usually looks like `host/SERVER-NAME.MYREALM.COM`.

If the Organization Service WSDL reports a UPN rather than SPN, then the CRM service is configured to run under a domain account. In this case, you must ensure that the domain admin has created an SPN under this service account in AD for the CRM hostname. In this case, the SPN is in the form *http/crm.mycompany.com*.

*Note*: The SPN is typically created to match the fully qualified DNS name that is used to access the CRM service.

=== NTLM Authentication

For connecting to Microsoft Dynamics CRM with NTLM authentication, the connector routes requests through Anypoint Platform Gateway Service.

The Anypoint Platform Gateway Service runs as a Windows service. Install the gateway service on a machine that is joined to the same domain as the Dynamics CRM instance that you wish to authenticate against.

If you do not have Anypoint Platform Gateway Service installed, you can download it from: https://repository-master.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org/mule/modules/anypoint-windows-gateway-service/1.2.0/anypoint-windows-gateway-service-1.2.0.zip.

To install:

. Unzip the downloaded file and run the .exe contained within.
. For your protection, the executable is signed by MuleSoft Inc.
. Follow the instructions to complete the installation.
. No further configuration is required.

After installing Anypoint Platform Gateway Service, configure the connector’s connection properties with the Username, Password, and the Organization Service URL.

Under NTLM authentication settings, set the Gateway Router Service Address to the address of the Anypoint Platform Gateway Service. This address is usually similar to +https://myserver.com:9000/router+.

At this point, the connection should be successfully tested.

== Operations

=== Create Record

Creates a record for an entity.

The following table lists operation inputs:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Usuage
|*Logical Name* |The logical name of the entity that the record belongs to.
|*Attributes* |A `Map<String, Object>` with the entity attribute names as the map's key. To create a payload for this operation, place a DataMapper transformer before the connector in the Mule flow.
|===

Output: A String containing the ID of the created record.

=== Update Record

Updates an existing record in an entity.

The following table lists operation inputs:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|*Logical Name* |The logical name of the entity that the record belongs to.
|*ID* |The ID of the record to update.
|*Attributes* |A `Map<String, Object>` with the entity attribute names as the map's keys. To create a payload for this operation, place a DataMapper transformer before the connector in the Mule flow.
|===

Output: Void. This operation does not return a value.

=== Delete Record

Deletes a record from an entity.

The following table lists operations inputs:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Usage
|*Logical Name* |The logical name of the entity that the record belongs to.

|===

== Data Considerations

=== Entity Reference

Entity reference attributes are accessible as String values that match the pattern `myattribute_targetentity_reference`.

To avoid conflicts, don't add fields to your CRM instance using this reserved naming scheme: `[*]_[*]_` reference.

As an example, the *Contact* Entity Reference attribute *TransactionCurrencyId* is a Lookup field that targets the entity `transactioncurrency`. The `transactioncurrencyid` of the `transactioncurrency` is accessible as a String in the attribute `transactioncurrencyid_transactioncurrency_reference`.

The Create and Update operations accept entity reference attributes. Following the example above, to create a *Contact* targeting a `transactioncurrency`, set the value of the attribute `transactioncurrencyid_transactioncurrency_reference` to the `transactioncurrencyid` of the record that's referenced.

The Retrieve Multiple operation also allows selecting and filtering of Entity Reference attributes. As an example for *Contact*, the following DataSense Query returns all the contact full names that where created by a particular *systemuserid*:

[source, code, linenums]
----
Select fullname From contact Where createdby_systemuser_reference = 
'c7a58b13-df19-491c-a918-1bc26eaf6eb3'
----

=== Picklist

Picklist attributes are accessible as Integer values.

As an example, the *Contact* attribute *familystatuscode* is accessible as an Integer value.

=== Money

Money attributes are accessible as BigDecimal values.

As an example, the *Contact* attribute *creditlimit* is accessible as a BigDecimal value.
