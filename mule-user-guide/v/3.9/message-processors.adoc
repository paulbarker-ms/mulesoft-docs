= Message Processors
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, message processors, elements, component

After Mule receives a message from a Message Source, it uses one or more message processors to process the message through a flow. 

These can transform, filter, enrich, and otherwise process the message as it transitions through your flow.



Message Processors can be categorized by function as follows:

* *Connectors* send and receive data, and plug into external data sources via standard protocols or third-party APIs.
* *Components* are flexible tools which perform business logic implemented in Java, Javascript, Groovy, Python, or Ruby. 
* *Filters* only allow certain messages to continue to be processed in a flow based on certain criteria.
* *Routers* control message flow to route, resequence, or split and aggregate messages in a flow.
* *Scopes* wrap snippets of code to define fine-grained behavior within a flow.
* *Transformers* convert message payload type and data format to facilitate communication between systems. 
* *Exception Strategies* handle any errors that occur during message processing.
* *Business Events* capture data related to key performance indicators
