= Passing Additional Arguments to the JVM to Control Mule
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, deploy, configure, jvm arguments, system properties, properties

The Wrapper provides several properties you can set as described in the article on link:http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/properties.html[Java Service Wrappers].

If you want to pass additional arguments to the JVM that runs Mule, you can add `wrapper.java.additional.n` entries to the `wrapper.conf` file in the `${MULE_HOME}/conf` directory, or you can pass the arguments at the command line by adding the `-M` switch.

For example, to set Mule's encoding, you could:

* Add `wrapper.java.additional.1=-Dmule.encoding=ISO-8859-1` to the Wrapper configuration file.
* Or you could add `-M-Dmule.encoding=ISO-8859-1` to the Mule script at the command line.

[CAUTION]
If you add `wrapper.java.additional.n` entries to the configuration file, you must change each instance of `n` to a consecutive number, or Java does not parse the properties correctly.
