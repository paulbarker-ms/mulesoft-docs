= Batch Streaming and Job Execution
:keywords: connectors, anypoint, studio, esb, batch, batch processing

*_Enterprise, CloudHub_*

Anypoint Studio comes bundled with the ability to stream batch processing and configure the order of batch job execution. 

== Streaming Batch Commits

Mule offers the ability to process fixed-size groups of records – say, upserting 100 records at a time from a CSV file to Salesforce. Mule also supports streaming commits, which enables you to batch process _all_ the records in the job instance, no matter how many or how large. For example, if you need to write millions of records from Salesforce to a CSV file, you can process the records as a streaming batch commit.

Instead of a list of elements that you receive with a fixed-size batch commit, the streaming functionality – an iterator – ensures that you receive _all_ the records in a batch job without running out of memory. By combining streaming batch commit and DataMapper streaming in a flow, you can transform large datasets in one single operation and one single write to disk. The example below illustrates the actions Mule takes to batch process streaming data.

[TIP]
====
To enable your application to batch process streaming data, configure _both_ the batch commit and the DataMapper to enable streaming.
====

[NOTE]
====
In general, you probably don't use batch streaming when sending data through an Anypoint Connector to a SaaS provider, like Salesforce, because SaaS providers often have restrictions on accepting streaming input. Rather, use streaming batch processing when writing to a file such as CSV, JSON, or XML.

=== Batch Commit Element

In the *Properties Editor* of *Batch Commit* element, click the checkbox to enable *Streaming*.

----
<batch:commit streaming="true" doc:name="Batch Commit">
----

=== DataMapper Element

In the *Mapping Editor* of the *DataMapper* element, click the mapping icon, then select *Configuration*.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<data-mapper:transform config-ref="listcontact_to_csv" doc:name="List<Contact> To CSV" stream="true"/>

[IMPORTANT]
====
Batch-processing streaming data affects the performance of your application, slowing the pace at which it processes transactions. Though performance slows, the trade-off of being able to batch-process streaming data may warrant using it in your implementation.
====

== Ordering Batch Job Execution

To account for situations in which different batch jobs may be competing for resources, you can adjust the configuration of the Batch's *Scheduling Strategy*. For example, if one batch job instance is dependent upon another's completion, you can set the scheduling strategy to sequentially process the batch job instances according to the order they were created. Where non-sequential processing of batch jobs could cause problems in data consistency, be sure to set the scheduling strategy to process them sequentially.

The following sections describe how the configuration of this attribute instructs Mule how to submit batch job instances to a target resource.

=== Ordered Sequential Attribute

Value of scheduling-strategy attribute:

`ORDERED_SEQUENTIAL _(Default)_ `

Mule executes batch job instances sequentially, according to the order in which Mule created them.

If Mule creates a job instance at 12:00:00 and then creates another at 12:00:01, Mule does not execute the second instance until the first one leaves the executable state.

*Note*: As this value is the default, the XML config does not explicitly display the configuration.

=== Round Robin Attribute

Value of scheduling-strategy attribute:

`ROUND_ROBIN`

Mule executes batch job instance according to a random, round robin pattern. a|
image:round_robin.png[round_robin]

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<batch:job name="testBatch1" scheduling-strategy="ROUND_ROBIN">
----

[NOTE]
If your application uses more than one batch job, you must individually define the scheduling strategy of each. Mule configures scheduling strategy at the batch job level, meaning that a ROUND_ROBIN or ORDERED_SEQUENTIAL configuration only applies to instances of the same batch job.

== Tips

* *Streaming from SaaS providers:* In general, you likely wouldn't use batch streaming when sending data through an Anypoint Connector TO a SaaS provider, like Salesforce, because SaaS providers often have restrictions on accepting streaming input. Rather, use streaming batch processing when writing to a file such as CSV, JSON, or XML.

* *Batch streaming and performance:* Batch processing streaming data does affect the performance of your application, slowing the pace at which it processes transactions. Though performance slows, the trade-off to be able to batch process streaming data may warrant using it in your implementation.

* *Batch streaming and access to items:* The biggest drawback to using batch streaming is that you have limited access to the items in the output. In other words, with a _fixed-size commit_, you get an unmodifiable list, thus allowing you to access and iteratively process its items; with _streaming commit_, you get a one-read, forward-only iterator. 

* *Setting multiple scheduling strategies:* Setting all your application's batch jobs’ scheduling strategies to ORDERED_SEQUENTIAL _does not_ ensure that job instances created in one batch job respect the order in which job instances were created in a separate batch job. Setting the scheduling strategy only enforces the order in which Mule processes instances of the same job.
