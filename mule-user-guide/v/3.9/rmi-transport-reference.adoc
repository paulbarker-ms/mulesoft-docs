:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, connector, endpoint, rmi, jrmi, java remote message, jrmp

The Java Remote Message Invocation (RMI) transport sends and receives Mule events over Java Remote Method Protocol (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JRMP[JRMP]). This transport has a dispatcher that invokes an RMI method and a polling receiver that repeatedly does the same.

You configure the RMI transport as follows:

*Note*: In the code examples in this guide, `spring-beans-current.xsd` is a placeholder. To locate the correct version, see http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/.

The connector looks for the `method` and `methodArgumentTypes`. It uses the payload as the argument.

== JNP Connector

If you want to use the Java naming protocol to bind to remote objects, you can use the JNP connector instead simply by using the `jnp` namespace.
