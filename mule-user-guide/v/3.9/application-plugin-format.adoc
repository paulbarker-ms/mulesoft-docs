Mule applications can make use of Application Plugins, which provide a way to reuse behavior across applications maintaining isolation per application.

A plugin is a 'zip' file with the following structure:

[source, code, linenums]
----
/
\- classes                 // plugin-specific expanded resources (e.g. logging configuration files, properties, etc
|- lib                     // plugin-specific jars
|- plugin.properties       // custom properties to be added to the registry instance used by the plugin (optional)
----

Application plugins must be placed in the folder `<mule_home>/apps/<app_name>/plugins`.

== Plugin Properties

The following properties are currently recognized on plugin.properties file:

* `loader.override` - provides fine-grained control over link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/classloader-control-in-mule[class loading] within a plugin.

Here are some things to consider regarding the plugins:

* Multiple plugins, such as connectors, can be bundled in the application.

* Each plugin must be packaged as a zip file following the mentioned structure.

* The plugins are deployed in natural sort order by 'zip' filename.

* Exploded plugins are not currently supported. The rationale for this is to encourage and maintain a simple plugin distribution model of just one file.

* The deployment lifecycle of the plugin is tied to the application.
