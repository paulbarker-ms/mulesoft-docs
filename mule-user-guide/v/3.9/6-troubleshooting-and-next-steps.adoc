[TIP]
You can now easily create a cluster through the Runtime Manager UI. See link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#create-a-cluster[Creating and Managing Clusters].

== Troubleshooting Ports

The *Mule HA Demo Bundle* uses the following ports on your local drive:

* 7777 for Mule server 1
* 7778 for Mule server 2
* 8585 for the Mule Management Console
* 8080 and 61616 for the WidgetUI Web app

If you currently use one or more of these ports for other purposes, you can change the ports that the WidgetUI Web app and Mule servers use.

=== Change the WidgetUI Port

In your *Terminal* or *Console*, execute the following script in the `cluster/widgetUI` folder: +
 `play run --http.port=YOUR_CUSTOM_PORT` +
 For example, execute `play run --http.port=8090`

=== Change the Servers’ Ports

In your *Terminal* or *Console*, execute a `startServer` script with the following system property: +
 `startServer1 -M-Dmule.mmc.bind.port=YOUR_CUSTOM_PORT` +
 For example, execute `startServer1 -M-Dmule.mmc.bind.port=7779`
