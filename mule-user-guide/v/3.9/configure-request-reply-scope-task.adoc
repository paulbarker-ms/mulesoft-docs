. Drag and drop an outbound-connector from the Mule Palette to the Request section of the scope and configure it to submit requests to your desired endpoint.
. Drag and drop an inbound-connector from the Mule Palette to the Reply portion of the scope and configure it to receive responses

The scope ensures that the activity that occurs within it proceeds asynchronously, relative to the rest of the flow.
