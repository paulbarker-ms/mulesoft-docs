= Configuring Mule to Run From a Script
:keywords: anypoint, on premises, on premise, amc

To start Mule from a script or from your IDE without using the Java Service Wrapper, you can use the `org.mule.MuleServer` class. This class accepts a couple of parameters.

[source]
----
org.mule.MuleServer -config mule-config.xml
----

or

[source]
----
org.mule.MuleServer -builder <fully qualified classname> -config appContext.xml
----

* *-config* specifies one or more configuration files to use. If this argument is omitted, it will look for and use `mule-config.xml` if it exists.

* *-builder* is a fully qualified classname of the configuration builder to use. If this is not set, the default `org.mule.config.builders.AutoConfigurationBuilder` is used, which will try to auto-detect configuration files based on available builders. In the most common scenario, this will resolve to `org.mule.config.spring.SpringXmlConfigurationBuilder`.

The easiest way to set the classpath is to include all JARs in the `./lib/mule` and `./lib/opt` directories of the distribution. You can look at the dependency report for the server and each of the modules to see exactly which JARs are required for a particular module.
