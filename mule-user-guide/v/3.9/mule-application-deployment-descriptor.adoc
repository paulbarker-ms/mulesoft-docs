= Mule Application Deployment Descriptor
:keywords: esb, deploy, configuration

Mule's deployment descriptor is a properties file (`mule-deploy.properties`) that controls how a Mule application should be deployed. A typical application, however, would rarely need to use many of the configuration properties available in the file, relying instead on defaults.

[WARNING]
If you're deploying multiple applications through a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/shared-resources[Shared Resources] structure, then you shouldn't set anything in the properties files, as there might potentially be conflicts between the various apps that share a domain. Instead, you can set environment variables over the scope of the deployed app, its domain and other apps under that domain. In Studio you can create these variables through the *Environment tab* of the *Run Configurations menu*, reachable via the dropdown menu next to the Play button.

Mule checks if there is a deployment descriptor file in the application root and uses it if available (it's optional).

Here's the list of supported configuration properties in the deployment descriptor:

[%header,cols="34,33,33"]
|===
|Name |Description |Default
|domain |Domain name for this application. Typically used to share common libraries and configuration between applications. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/shared-resources[Shared Resources] |"default"
|config.resources |A comma separated list of configuration file names for this application. Typical use is to support split configurations declaratively. An alternative is to have a default `mule-config.xml` file import extra configuration pieces. All configuration files are monitored for redeployment. |`mule-config.xml` from the app root is used if nothing else is specified
|redeployment.enabled |Allows explicitly disabling application hot-redeployment. Dropping a new version of the application archive in the `$MULE_HOME/apps` will still redeploy the application. Any values other than `true, yes, on` are treated as `false` and disable the config change monitor. |Enabled by default
|encoding |Default encoding, used throughout the application if none specified explicitly on, for example,. a transformer |UTF-8
|config.builder |Configuration builder to use for parsing the application config file. |AutoConfigurationBuilder
|scan.packages (since Mule 3.1) |The application's classpath is no longer scanned for iBeans annotations (`@Call`, `@Template` and `@IBeanGroup`). The regular Mule annotations (for example, `@Transformer` still work). To reactivate classpath scanning, configure a comma-separated list of package names to scan for annotations at startup. |Empty by default
|loader.override |Overrides default class loading. The property value is specified as a comma-separated list of classes, packages, or both. Blocking can also be specified by preceding the classes or packages in the list with a - (dash/minus sign). If a class is specified in the blocking list, its lookup is performed within the application or plugin only, and not in Mule. For further details, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/classloader-control-in-mule[Classloader Control in Mule]. |Empty by default
| log.configFile
| The location of the `log4j2.xml` configuration file, that sets various parameters of the logging, such as synchronous vs asynchronous. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/logging-in-mule[Logging in Mule].
| `MULE_HOME/conf`
|===

Two things to note:

* Classloader domains can feature different versions of the same library for different sets of applications.
* Unless otherwise instructed, the default domain is used. You can specify a custom domain using the `domain` property in the application deployment descriptor.

Below is an example of the contents of a simple deployment configuration file:

[source, code, linenums]
----
redeployment.enabled=true
encoding=UTF-8
domain=default
config.resources=sfdc-outbound-messaging-example.xml
----

== Options

An application may also contain a `mule-app.properties` file in the application root (right next to the `mule-deploy.properties` file). The `mule-app.properties` file is the place to put any custom properties for the application. Mule will make them available in the registry and they can be accessed in two ways:

* At application startup in the configuration file. Use a `${foo`} placeholder (or any Mule expression which can get to the registry) to lookup a `foo` value.
* In the code (for example, by implementing `MuleContextAware`). A registry ref is then accessible through `muleContext.getRegistry()`. You can then use any suitable lookup method on this instance.

== Deployment Descriptor in a Domain

Just as in Applications, you can add a `mule-deploy.properties` in the `src/main/domain` folder of link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/shared-resources[a domain project]. This deployment descriptor file only supports the following properties:


[%header,cols="34,33,33"]
|===
|Name |Description |Default
|redeployment.enabled |Allows explicitly disabling domain hot-redeployment. Dropping a new version of the domain archive in the `$MULE_HOME/apps` will still redeploy the domain. Any values other than `true, yes, on` are treated as `false` and disable the config change monitor. |Enabled by default
|loader.override |Overrides default class loading. The property value is specified as a comma-separated list of classes, packages, or both. Blocking can also be specified by preceding the classes or packages in the list with a - (dash/minus sign). If a class is specified in the blocking list, its lookup is performed within the domain or plugin only, and not in Mule. For further details, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/classloader-control-in-mule[Classloader Control in Mule]. |Empty by default
