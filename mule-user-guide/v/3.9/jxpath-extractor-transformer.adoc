= JXPath Extractor Transformer

_*Deprecated*_

[NOTE]
Mule 3.6.0 includes support for version 3.0 of the XPath standard, which is compatible with XPath 2.0. As part of this upgrade, the JXPath extractor transformer has been deprecated in favor of theÂ `xpath3` function. For details, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/xml-module-reference[XML Module Reference].

The JXPath extractor transformer evaluates an XPath expression against the current message and returns the result. By default, a single result will be returned. If multiple values are expected, set the `singleResult` property to false, which will return a list of values. This property is available for strings only (not XML nodes).

You configure the JXPath extractor transformer as follows:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<jxpath-extractor-transformer name="invoice" expression="/book/title" singleResult="false"/>
----
