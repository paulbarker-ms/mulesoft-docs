== Client Authentication for a CloudHub API

The *Mule OAuth 2.0 Secure Token Service* functionality on *CloudHub* is limited due to the known link:/runtime-manager/managing-application-data-with-object-stores#semantics-and-storage-limits[Object Store limitations].

If those limitations don't affect your development, you can use the *Mule OAuth 2.0 Secure Token Service* on Cloudhub. Otherwise, create your own Object Store and configure the OAuth2 module to use your custom Object Store instead of the default. 
For more information, go to the link:http://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[MuleSoft Customer Portal] and open a ticket.

Use Mule Secure Token Service to apply Oauth 2.0 to your Web service provider to:

* grant consumers of your Web service limited access to secure data
* avoid disclosing an end user's access credentials to a Web service consumer
* retain the authority to revoke the consumerâ€™s access to an end user's secure data at any time

== Client Authentication Required by a Server

Configure authentication in your client Mule app when sending requests to a service that requires authentication, such as the Github OAuth2 server described in link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/authentication-in-http-requests#oauth2-authorization-code[OAuth2 - Authorization Code]. 

== Authentication to Protect an API from Clients

When you want to protect your API or app from receiving requests from unauthorized access, use an API Manager policy, such as the OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy. To expose a Web service protected by OAuth 2.0 security, see link:/api-manager/building-an-external-oauth-2.0-provider-application[API Manager documentation].
