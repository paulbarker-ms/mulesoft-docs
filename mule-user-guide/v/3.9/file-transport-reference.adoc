= File Transport Reference
:keywords: anypoint studio, connectors, files, file connector, endpoints

The File transport allows files on the local file system to be read from and written to. The connector can be configured to filter the file it reads and the way files are written, such as whether Mule places the output in a new file or appends the output to an existing file.

<!-- Typical Connector for Outbound Endpoint: Write files -->
<file:connector name="output" outputAppend="true" outputPattern="#[server.dateTime]-#[message.inboundProperties['originalFilename']]" />
----

=== Endpoint Syntax

You can express file endpoints using standard File URI syntax:

[source]
----
file://<path>[MULE:?params]
----

For example, to connect to a directory called `/temp/files`:

==== Unix

[source]
----
file:///temp/files
----

*Note:* The extra slash denotes a path from the root (absolute path).

==== Windows

[source]
----
file:///C:/temp/files
----

The Unix style still works in Windows if you map to a single drive (the one Mule was started from).

To specify a relative path use:

[source]
----
file://./temp
----

Or:

[source]
----
file://temp
----

*Note*: Only two slashes are used for the protocol, so it's a relative path.

[NOTE]
In Unix, relative paths are relative to the root directory ( / ). For example, specifying `file://temp` indicates directory `/temp`. In Windows, relative paths are relative to the drive where Mule resides, for example `C:\`. 

[NOTE]
To specify a Windows relative path, use the backslash \, for example `\temp` specifies `C:\temp` if Mule resides in drive `C:\`.

Or:

[source]
----
file://?address=./temp
----

To connect to a Windows network drive (only from a Windows Environment):

[source]
----
file://?address=192.168.0.1/temp/
----

==== Inbound Endpoint

[source,xml]
----
<file:inbound-endpoint connector-ref="input" path="/tmp/input"/>
----

==== Outbound Endpoint

[source,xml]
----
<file:outbound-endpoint connector-ref="output" path="/tmp/output"/>
----

== Considerations

Mule provides lots of functionality ready to use that can just be modified by changing a XML file. Everyone knows how to handle files in their programming language, but when advanced features are required, coding gets complex. Mule easily allows you to rename and archive files and handles the uncomfortable task of validating when input files are completely generated.

* This transport should be used to both read and write files in the filesystem. Use the inbound endpoint to read files every certain period of time, filtering input files by different name patterns and deleting, moving or leaving the file as it is once processed. The outbound endpoint allows you to generate new files (the file name can be defined in runtime) or to append content to an existing file.
* Take into account that the account running mule (in standalone mode, the user that launched the Mule server, if not, the user which runs the Application Server) should have read and/or write permissions on the directories configured for this transport.
* Be careful not to permanently delete or overwrite input/output files. Be careful when using, for example, _autoDelete_ and _moveToDirectory_ attributes.
* Check the examples below and find out how to copy files from one directory to another, process input files while saving a backup of the input file and creating a new file with a specific name.
* Though most configuration parameters can be defined globally at in the connector, they can be overridden in the endpoint configuration.
* If streaming is enabled a `ReceiverFileInputStream` is used as the payload for each file that is processed. This input stream's `close()` method takes care of moving the file or deleting it. Streams are closed by transformers reading the input stream. If you process the stream in your own component implementation make sure to properly close the stream after reading.
* When configured to use a working directory, Mule add two properties to the message to indicate the source from which the file was read: +
** `sourceFileName`: contains the same value as the originalFilename property which Mule uses when no workDirectory is configured
** `sourceDirectory`: contains the same value as the originalDirectory property which Mule uses when no workDirectory is configured.

== Features

* Read files at a regular polling interval
* Write files

== Usage

To use the file transport in your Mule configuration, <<Schema>> and use the `<file:connector>`, `<file:inbound-endpoint>` and/or `<file:outbound-endpoint>` elements. See <<Example Configurations>> below.

You can use the following expressions inside attributes:

[source,code, linenums]
----
#[function:dateStamp]
#[function:datestamp:dd-MM-yy]
#[function:systime]
#[function:uuid]
#[message.inboundProperties.originalFilename]
#[function:count]
#[message.inboundProperties['_messagepropertyname'_]
----

For new dateTime functions introduced into MEL with Mule 3.4 and newer, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/mule-expression-language-date-and-time-functions[MEL Date and Time Functions]. 

== Example Configurations

The following simple example copies files from _/tmp/input_ ❸ to _/tmp/output_ ❹ every 1 second (1000 ms) ❷. As input files are not deleted ❶ they are processed every time. Changing *autoDelete* to *true* just moves files.

The following example moves files ❶ from _/tmp/input_ to _/tmp/output_ every 5 second (5000 ms) ❸, saving a backup file of the original file (with the extension backup) in _/tmp/backup_ ❹. The new file is renamed with the current date and time as prefix ❺.

**Note: fileAge** prevents moving files that are still being generated as the file has to be untouched for at least half a second ❷.

== Configuration Options

File Transport *inbound endpoint* attributes:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description |Default
|*autoDelete* |Set this attribute to `false` if you don't want Mule to delete the file after processing the file |`true`
|*fileAge* |Setting this value (minimum age in milliseconds for a file to be processed) is useful when consuming large files, as Mule waits before reading this file until the file last modification timestamp indicates that the file is older than this value |`true`
|*moveToDirectory* |Use this parameter to have Mule save a backup copy of the file it reads. *Note*: If a file already exists in the directory, moveToDirectory moves the file to the directory only one time. Subsequent attempts to move the same file to the directory result in Mule throwing an exception. | 
|*moveToPattern* |Use this parameter together with `moveToPattern` to rename a copy of the backed up file | 
|*pollingFrequency* |Set the frequency in milliseconds for checking the read directory |`1000`
|*recursive* |Use this parameter so Mule recurses when a directory is read |`false`
|*streaming* |If you want the payload to be a byte array instead of a FileInputStream, set this parameter to `false` |`true`
|*workDirectory*† |If you require moving input files before they are processed by Mule, then assign a working directory (in the same file system) with this parameter | 
|*workFileNamePattern* |Use this parameter together with *workDirectory* to rename input files before processing them | 
|===

† When configured to use a working directory, Mule adds two properties to the message to indicate the source from which the file was read:

* `sourceFileName`: Contains the same value as the originalFilename property which Mule uses when no workDirectory is configured
* `sourceDirectory`: Contains the same value as the originalDirectory property which Mule uses when no workDirectory is configured.

File Transport *outbound endpoint* attributes

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description |Default
|*outputAppend* |If the file to be written already exists, set this parameter to true to append new contents instead of overwriting the file. |`false`
|*outputPattern* |The pattern to use when writing a file to disk. |

*Type*: `string` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|=====

No child elements for `outbound-endpoint`.


== File to Byte Array Transformer

The file-to-byte-array-transformer element configures a transformer that reads the contents of a java.io.File into a byte array (byte[]).

No child elements for `file-to-byte-array-transformer`.

== File to String Transformer

The file-to-string-transformer element configures a transformer that reads the contents of a java.io.File into a java.lang.String.

No child elements for `file-to-string-transformer`.

*Note*: This transformer does not close file streams. This prevents files from being deleted or moved if the flow is asynchronous. If you have streaming enabled for an asynchronous endpoint, use the `ObjectToString` transformer instead.

== Filename Wildcard Filter

The `filename-wildcard-filter` element configures a filter that can be used to restrict the files being processed by applying wildcard expressions to the filename. For example, you can read only .xml and .txt files by entering the following: `<file:filename-wildcard-filter pattern="**.txt,**.xml"/>`

No child elements for `filename-wildcard-filter`.

== Filename Regex Filter

The filename-regex-filter element configures a filter that can be used to restrict the files being processed by applying Java regular expressions to the filename, such as pattern="myCustomerFile(.*)".

No child elements for `filename-regex-filter`.

== Expression Filename Parser

The expression-filename-parser element configures the ExpressionFilenameParser, which can use any expression language supported by Mule to construct a file name for the current message. Expressions can be xpath, xquery, ognl, mvel, header, function, and more.

*Note*: The `ognl` expression has been deprecated and will be removed in Mule 4.0.

No attributes or child elements for `expression-filename-parser`.

For example, an XPath expression can be defined to pull a message ID out of an XML message and use that as the file name as follows:

[source,xml]
----
#[xpath:/message/header/@id]
----

Following is an example of using the parser:

[source,xml, linenums]
----
<file:connector name="FileConnector" >
  <file:expression-filename-parser/>
</file:connector>
...
<file:outbound-endpoint path="file://temp"
outputPattern="#[message.inboundProperties['originalFilename']]--#[function:datestamp].txt"/>
----

This parser supersedes `<legacy-filename-parser>` from previous releases of Mule. The following demonstrates how to achieve the same results when using `<expression-filename-parser>` over `<legacy-filename-parser>`.

* `#[DATE] : #[function:dateStamp]`
* `#[DATE:dd-MM-yy] : #[function:datestamp:dd-MM-yy]`
* `#[SYSTIME] : #[function:systime]`
* `#[UUID] : #[function:uuid]`
* `#[ORIGINALNAME] : #[message.inboundProperties.originalFilename]`
* `#[COUNT] : #[function:count]` - Note: This is a global counter. If you want a local counter per file connector then you should use the `legacy-filename-parser`.
* `#[_message property name_] : #[message.inboundProperties['_messagepropertyname_']`

== Custom Filename Parser

The custom-filename-parser element allows the user to specify a custom filename parser. The implementation must implement org.mule.transport.file.FilenameParser.

=== Attributes of custom-filename-parser

* *Attribute Name*: `class`
* *Type*: `string`
* *Required*: yes
* *Description*: The implementation class name that implements org.mule.transport.file.FilenameParser.

No child elements for `custom-filename-parser`.

== Abstract File Name Parser

The `abstract-filenameParser` element is a placeholder for filename parser elements. The filename parser is set on the connector used when writing files to a directory. The parser  converts the outputPattern attribute to a string using the parser and the current message. The default implementation used is expression-filename-parser, but you can also specify a custom-filename-parser.

No attributes or child elements for `abstract-filenameParser`.

== Extending This Module or Transport Best Practices

If reading input files which are generated directly in the input path, configure the _fileAge_ attribute in the connector or endpoint. In this way, Mule processes these files after they are completely written to disk.
