= Single Resource Transactions
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb

Use a *Single Resource transaction* (also known as a simple transaction or local transaction) to send or receive messages using only one single resource: JMS, VM, or JDBC.

The example below illustrates a flow which includes a single resource transaction applied to inbound and outbound JMS connectors. 

[source,xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="testFlow1" doc:name="testFlow1">
        <jms:inbound-endpoint queue="test.in" connector-ref="JMS" doc:name="JMS">
            <jms:transaction action="ALWAYS_BEGIN"/>
        </jms:inbound-endpoint>
....
        <jms:outbound-endpoint doc:name="JMS" connector-ref="JMS" queue="test.out">
            <jms:transaction action="ALWAYS_JOIN"/>
        </jms:outbound-endpoint>
    </flow>
----

The configuration above defines a JMS connector that receives on a "test.in" queue and another JMS connector that sends on a "test.out" queue. The action attribute dictates how Mule initiates a transaction. Within this flow, Mule starts a new transaction for every message it receives (inbound connector), and always joins a transaction in progress for every message it sends (outbound connector).  Mule commits only those messages which successfully pass through the complete flow; if at any point in the flow a message throws an exception, Mule rolls back the transaction.
