= Creating Custom Routers
:keywords: customize, custom message routers, custom routers

Typically, you implement custom routing in Mule with filters, but occasionally you may need to implement a custom router.

== Custom Outbound Routers

Outbound routers control how a message gets routed to a list of endpoints. For example, sometimes a message gets routed based on simple rules or business logic, whereas in other cases you may multicast a message to every router.

The easiest way to write an outbound router is to extend the link:http://www.mulesoft.org/docs/site/3.8.0/apidocs/org/mule/routing/outbound/AbstractOutboundRouter.html[org.mule.routing.outbound.AbstractOutboundRouter] class:

[source, java, linenums]
----
import org.mule.routing.outbound.AbstractOutboundRouter;
 
public class CustomOutboundRouter extends AbstractOutboundRouter
{
....
}
----

There are two methods you must implement that control how messages are routed through the system. First, you must implement the `isMatch` method. This determines if a message should be processed by the router.

For example, to route only messages that have a payload containing the string "hello":

[source, code, linenums]
----
public boolean isMatch(MuleMessage message) throws RoutingException
{
   return "hello".equals(message.getPayloadAsString());
}
----

The second method you must implement is the `route` method. Each outbound router has a list of endpoints that are associated with it. The `route` method contains the logic to control how the event is propagated to the endpoints.

For example, if there were two endpoints you want to route to based on a condition, you would use this method to select the endpoint:

[source, code, linenums]
----
MuleEvent route(MuleEvent event) throws MessagingException
{
    OutboundEndpoint ep = null;
    if (isConditionMet(event))
    {
        ep = getRoutes().get(0);
    }
    else
    {
        ep = getRoutes().get(1);
    }
....
----

Once you've selected an endpoint, you must call `process()` on it.
