= @Schedule Annotation
:keywords: annotations, custom java code

The `@Schedule` annotation is a method level annotation that is used to schedule how often the method is called. To call a method every second you could use the following -

[source, java, linenums]
----
public class PingMe
{
    @Schedule(interval = 1000)
    public String ping()
    {
        return "ping!";
    }
}
----

The interval is defined in milliseconds. When the `PingMe` class is loaded in the Mule container a schedule will be set up to call the `ping()` method every second.

The `@Schedule` annotation also supports <<Introduction to Cron expressions>> expressions. These provide a powerful way to express time triggers.

The `getStatus` method below will be called every hour.

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Schedule(cron = "* * 0 * * ?") //every hour
public String getStatus()
{
    //use Twitter iBean
}
----

=== Arguments

[%header,cols="34,33,33"]
|===
|Argument |Description |Required
|cron |A cron command that specifies when to call the method. |You must set either `cron` or `interval`.
|interval |The number of milliseconds between two scheduled invocations of the method. |You must set either `cron` or `interval`
|config |A reference to the `org.mule.transport.quartz.config.ScheduleConfigBuilder` object that is used to configure this scheduler job. This attribute can be used to reference a local schedule configuration builder using the name of the builder. Local configBuilder references can use the `id` value passed into the ScheduleConfigBuilder |No
|startDelay |The number of milliseconds that will elapse before the first event is fired. The default is -1, which means the first event is fired as soon as the application is started. |No

=== Introduction to Cron expressions

Cron is a UNIX tool that has been around for ever and is used for scheduling operating system tasks. It uses "cron expressions", which are able to create firing schedules such as: "At 8:00am every Weekday" or "every 5 minutes". Cron expressions are powerful but can be a little confusing so I have provided some examples below. A cron expression consists of 7 fields, one of which is optional, listed below.

== Some examples

* 0 0 12 * * ? Fire at 12pm (noon) every day
* 0 15 10 ? * * Fire at 10:15am every day
* 0 15 10 * * ? 2009 Fire at 10:15am every day during the year 2009
* 0 * 14 * * ? Fire every minute starting at 2pm and ending at 2:59pm, every day
* 0 0/5 14 * * ? Fire every 5 minutes starting at 2pm and ending at 2:55pm, every day
* 0 15 10 ? * 6L Fire at 10:15am on the last Friday of every month
* 0 11 11 11 11 ? Fire every November 11th at 11:11am
