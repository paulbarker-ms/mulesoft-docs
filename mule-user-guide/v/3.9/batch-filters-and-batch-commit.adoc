= Batch Filters and Batch Commit
:keywords: filters, connectors, anypoint, studio, batch

*_Enterprise, CloudHub_*

Using batch processing, you can refine the work that a batch step performs upon the records it processes.

* You can set *filters* upon batch steps so as to only accept some records for processing.
* You can *commit* records in groups, sending them as bulk upserts to external sources or services.

This document outlines how and when to use batch filters and the batch commit wrapper.


== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/[Anypoint Studio], have reviewed the overview and basic anatomy of link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/batch-processing[Batch Processing], and that you understand how batch jobs handle link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/batch-processing[records which fail processing]. You should also consider link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/batch-streaming-and-job-execution#streaming-batch-commits[Streaming Batch Commits].

== Filters

You can apply one or more filters as attributes to any number of batch steps within your batch job. By having batch steps accept only some records for processing, you streamline processing so that Mule focuses only on the data which is relevant for a particular batch step.

For example, you could apply a filter to the second batch step in your batch job to make sure that the second step only attempts to process records which didn't fail during processing in the first batch step. To put this in context of a use case, imagine a batch job which uses its first batch step to check to see if a Salesforce contact exists for a record; the second batch step updates each existing Salesforce contact with new information. In such a case, you could apply a filter to the second batch step to ensure it only processes records that didn't fail during the first batch step.

Filters are applied within batch steps. Use an *Accept Expression* to process only those records which, relative to the MEL expression, evaluate to true; if the record evaluates to false, the batch step does not process the record. In other words, those records with a filter expression that resolves to false are the ones Mule filters _out_.

The example below filters out all records where the age is less than 21; the batch step does not process those records.

<batch:step name="adultsOnlyStep" accept-expression="#[payload.age > 21]">
----
....
------


Use an *Accept Policy* to process only those records which, relative to the value of the accept policy attribute, evaluate to true. Refer to the table below for a list of the available values for the accept policy. The example below illustrates the second batch step in a batch job that processes only those records that failed processing during the preceding step. In the first batch step, Mule checked each record to see if it had an existing Salesforce contact; the second batch step, which creates a contact for each record, processes only the failed records (that is, records that failed to have an existing account). 

[%header,cols="25a,75a"]
|===
|Accept Policy |When evaluates to TRUE
|NO_FAILURES |_Default_ +
Batch step processes only those records that _succeeded_ processing in all preceding steps
|ONLY_FAILURES |Batch step processes only those records that _failed_ processing in a preceding batch step
|ALL |Batch step processes all records, regardless of whether they failed processing in a preceding batch step

=== Filter Characteristics 

* Batch filters only apply to batch steps which, in turn, are only usable link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/batch-processing#process[within the batch process phase] of a batch job. You cannot apply filters with the Input or On Complete phases.

* If you don't apply filters to a batch step, the batch processes only those records that _succeeded_ processing in all preceding steps. In other words, the default Accept Policy applied to all batch steps is NO_FAILURES.

* When a batch job instance exceeds its `max-failed-records` value, regardless of the filter set on the batch step, the step does not process any records, and simply pushes the failed batch job instance to the On Complete phase. Read more about link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/batch-processing#handling-failures-during-batch-processing[failure handling in batch jobs].

* Refer to link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/batch-processing-reference[Batch Reference] for details regarding batch step attributes.

* Where you apply both types of filters, Mule evaluates them in the following order:
+
. Accept Policy
+
. Accept Expression

== Batch Commit

You can use a *Batch Commit* scope in a batch step to accumulate a subset of records within a batch for bulk upsert to an external source or service. For example, rather than upserting each individual contact (that is, a record) in a batch to Google Contacts, you can configure a Batch Commit to accumulate, say, 100 records, then upsert all of them to Google Contacts in one chunk.

Within a batch step, the only place you can apply it, you use a Batch Commit to wrap an outbound message source. See the example below.

*Note:* See also link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/batch-streaming-and-job-execution#streaming-batch-commits[Streaming Batch Commits].

    <batch:commit size="100">
        <google-contacts:/>
    </batch:commit>
</batch:step>

....

=== Batch Commit Characteristics 

* Batch Commit scopes can only exist in batch steps which, in turn, are only usable link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/batch-processing#process[within the batch process phase] of a batch job. You cannot use batch commits within the Input or On Complete phases.

* A commit can only wrap the final element within the batch step in which it resides.

* Several *Anypoint Connectors* have the ability to handle record-level errors without failing a whole batch commit (i.e. upsert). At runtime, these connectors keep track of which records were successfully accepted by the target resource, and which failed to upsert. Thus, rather than failing a complete group of records during a commit activity, the connector simply upserts as many records as it can, and tracks any failures for notification. The short – but soon to grow – list of such connectors follows:

** Salesforce
** Google Contacts
** Google Calendars
** NetSuite
** Database

* Refer to link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/batch-processing-reference[Batch Reference] for details regarding batch step attributes.

* Batch processing does not support job-instance-wide transactions. You can define a transaction inside a batch step that processes each record in a separate transaction. (Think of it like a step within a step.) Such a transaction must start and end within the step's boundaries.

* You cannot share a transaction between a batch step and a batch commit that exists within the step. Any transaction that the batch step starts, ends before the batch commit begins processes. In other words, a transaction cannot cross the barrier between a batch step and the batch commit it contains.

=== Mutable Records Inside Commit Blocks

In previous versions of Mule, the commit block exposed only the grouped record’s payload and didn't allow you to change those payloads nor to retrieve the associated link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/record-variable[record variables].
Since 3.8, Mule allows you to access the grouped records' payloads and variables from within the Batch commit block and process them using the Mule Expression Language (MEL).

==== Sequential Access

You can persistently go over each record's payload and sequentially store it as a record variable. +
During the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/batch-processing#process[process phase] of your batch job, you can replace, change, or store the payload data.

By adding a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/foreach[Foreach Scope] you can iterate trough a fixed size commit block, and use the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/expression-component-reference[Expression Component Reference] to modify the payload and create a record variable for each collected record.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<batch:step name="commitStep">
<batch:commit size="10">
	<foreach>
		<expression-component>
			record.payload = 'foo';
			record.recordVars['marco'] = 'polo';
		</expression-component>
	</foreach>
</batch:commit>
</batch:step>
----

////
Additionally you can use this for streaming commits:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<batch:step name="commitStep">
	<batch:commit streaming="true">
	    <foreach>
			<expression-component>
				record.payload = 'foo';
				record.recordVars['marco'] = 'polo';
			</expression-component>
		</foreach>
	</batch:commit>
</batch:step>
----
////

The sequential access method assumes that:

. The commit size matches the amount of aggregated records.
. There is a direct correlation between the aggregated records and the items in the list.

==== Random Access

You can use the `records` variable to access random records without the need of iterating. This variable provides a random access list that is accessible across the commit block.

[NOTE]
The _counter_ variable is an immutable list used by `Foreach` to keep track of the iteration.

You can carry out the same result as the example above by specifying an arbitrary index number for the _records_ list instead of sequentially access each record:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<batch:step name="commitStep">
    <batch:commit size="10">
		<foreach>
        	<expression-component>
        		records[0].payload = 'foo';
        	 	records[0].recordVars['marco'] = 'polo';
        	</expression-component>
		</foreach>
    </batch:commit>
</batch:step>
----

Using random access, you can change a record's payload at any index position in the commit block.

[TIP]
====
Due to memory restrictions, random access is not supported for streaming commits.

The record payloads for random access are exposed as an `immutable List` and since streaming commits implies having access to the entire set of records, without a fixed commit size we can't guaranteed that all records will fit in memory.

When streaming commits, always use the sequential access method.

== Examples

This example uses batch processing to address a use case in which the contents of a comma-separated value file (CSV) of leads – comprised of names, birthdays, and email addresses must be uploaded to Salesforce. To avoid duplicating any leads, the batch job checks to see if a lead exists before uploading data to Salesforce.

For more information, see:

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/batch-processing[Batch Processing] for a full description of the steps the batch job takes in each phase of processing.
* https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?search=import%20leads%20salesforce[Example: Import Leads Into Salesforce].

The `insert-lead` batch step employs both an *Accept Expression* and *Batch Commit* (see below).

Following the example above, assume that you would like to log the generated Salesforce ID of each commit.
You can use the <<Sequential Access>> method with a Foreach scope containing the expression: + `record.recordVars['sfdcld'] = payload.wrapped.id'. This automatically gets you a variable called `record` to hold a reference to one of the aggregated records.

Furthermore, you can try to modify the payload of the first record by simply referencing it using <<Random Access>> from a new Expression component outside the Foreach scope.
The `Expression component` should be:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<expression-component doc:name="Expression">
  records[1].payload = 'New payload for the second record'
</expression-component>
----

This only modifies the payload of the second record, and if you check your `LoggerMessageProcessor` for each payload, it catches something like this:
[source, source, linenums]
----
LoggerMessageProcessor: {FirstName=John, LastName=Doe, Email=john.doe@texasComp.com, Phone=096548763}
LoggerMessageProcessor: New payload for the second record
