This section describes configuring Mule to run as a Linux or Unix daemon, a Windows service, or from a script.


[NOTE]
This section deals with deploying to standalone instances of the Mule runtime. To take full advantage of managing and monitoring features, you can deploy to the same Mule runtime via the link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager]. See link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies[Deployment Strategies] for a deeper look at the different deployment alternatives offered by the platform.
