== XML Configuration File

The way to configure a Mule application is with an XML file that uses custom Mule namespaces. By default, a Spring configuration builder takes this XML file to create Mule artifacts and register them with a Mule runtime instance.

Use one of the two namespaces in your Mule XML Configuration file:

* `+http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans+` 
* `+http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-current.xsd+`

== Spring Application Contexts

Mule offers several options for creating and managing link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/spring-application-contexts[Spring Application Contexts] for your application.

[TIP]
Build Spring beans to define component behaviors which Mule applications can reference. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/using-spring-beans-as-flow-components[Using Spring Beans as Flow Components]

== Spring Bean Definition Profiles

Muleâ€™s XML configuration file takes advantage of Spring 4.1.6's ability to create *bean definition profiles*. You can use Spring bean definition profiles to register different beans for different target environments, instead of using one bean for all target environments. For more information, see link:http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-definition-profiles[Bean Definition profiles] in the Spring Framework Reference.
