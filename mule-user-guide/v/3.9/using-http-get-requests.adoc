= Using HTTP GET Requests
:keywords: cxf

CXF has built-in support for understanding GET requests, which use the following format: +

----

http://host/service/OPERATION/PARAM_NAME/PARAM_VALUE
----

For example:

[source, java, linenums]
----
@WebService(endpointInterface = "org.mule.samples.echo.components.EchoService",
    serviceName = "echo")
public class EchoComponent implements EchoService
{
    public String echo(String string)
    {
        return string;
    }
}
----

The above Echo service is hosted in Mule on the endpoint cxf: http://localhost:65081/services/EchoUMO, so you can access the service from a simple web browser by typing the following:

http://localhost:65081/services/EchoUMO/echo/string/hello

This will send the value "hello" for the `string` parameter to the `echo()` method.

[WARNING]
Due to a bug in CXF, this is only supported with the JAX-WS frontend.
