:keywords: anypoint studio, outbound properties, inbound properties

Use a *property transformer* to set, remove, or copy properties on the outbound scope of a message. This transformer transforms only _outbound_ properties. Note that you cannot manipulate inbound scope properties, as those are automatically generated by the message source. To learn more about message scopes, refer to link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/mule-concepts[Mule Concepts].

*<<Complete Code Example>>*

The property transformer differs from the variable transformer and the session variable transformer. Refer to the table below for a comparison of these three transformers.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|  |Property Transformer |Variable Transformer |Session Variable Transformer
|*Use* |Use to set, remove, or copy properties on the outbound scope of a message. |Use to set or remove a variable on the message, tied to the current flow. |Use to set or remove a variable that is tied to the current message for its entire lifecycle, across multiple flows, applications, and even servers.
|*Persistence* |Once a message hits an outbound-connector, all properties in the outbound scope are sent with the message, in the form of transport-specific metadata (HTTP headers for an HTTP outbound-connector, for example). |Variables set with a variable transformer persist only for the current flow and cannot cross the transport barrier. |Session variables set with a session variable transformer persist for the entire message lifecycle, regardless of transport barriers.
|===

To access the property that you have set on a message earlier in a flow, or in a different flow in the application, use a MEL expression.  For example, if you want to route messages according to the `timeStamp` property you added to the header earlier in processing, you can use an expression in a choice router to access the `outboundProperties` property and route accordingly. Refer to the example below, where the expression `#[message.outboundProperties=timeStamp]` accesses the timeStamp property and evaluates to the value of the property.

|*doc:name* |
Customize to display a unique name for the transformer in your application, as shown in the example below.

Note: Attribute not required in Mule Standalone configuration.

|*propertyName* |
The name of the property that you are setting, copying, or removing. Can be a string or a Mule expression.

Note: If you are using the remove-property or copy-properties element, you may use a wildcard "*" character. For example, a copy-properties transformer with a property name "http.*" copies all properties whose names begin with "http." from the inbound scope to the outbound scope.

|*value* |The value of the property that you are setting. This attribute is only relevant for the set-property element. Can be a string or a Mule expression.

== Example

In the example below, we want to connect to a web service protected by an link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication[HTTP basic authentication] mechanism. In order to do that, our HTTP request needs to include a header, Authorization, which contains the username and password that allows the request go through. The properties transformer shown below sets an outbound property named Authorization and applies the value that is required to authenticate the message.

The following sets a property with:

== Referencing Properties Elsewhere

After you set a new property, how do you call it and use it elsewhere in your flow?

* If you select any component in your flow that precedes the creation of the property,
you can see the component in the Metadata Explorer, under the *Outbound Properties* section.
+
image:properties+metadata+explorer.jpeg[properties+metadata+explorer]
+
* You can reference the component in any field in any component that accepts link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/mule-expression-language-mel[Mule Expression Language (MEL)], calling it through the following expression:

[source]
----
#[message.outboundProperties.propertyName]
----

[TIP]
In Studio, the autocomplete feature can help you out by displaying a list of available properties at that particular part of the flow. Position your cursor in a field and press CTRL + Space to see field options. For more information, see link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/#show-attribute-options[Anypoint Studio Essentials > Show Attribute Options].

* You can reference a component inside any custom Java Class, calling it through the following:

[source]
----
message.getOutboundProperty("propertyName");
----

See a basic Java Class that implements this

[source, java, linenums]
----
include::_sources/property-transformer-reference_2.java[]
----

[TIP]
This Java Class takes an existing property named `myProperty` and makes it into the message payload.
