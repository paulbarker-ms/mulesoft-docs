= Message Filter
:keywords: anypoint studio, filters, conditional, gates

A message filter is used by a message processor to determine whether to handle incoming events or messages. A Message Filter may also include nested filters. Nested filters let you apply more complex logic to the filter. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/logic-filter[Logic Filter]Â for more details about nesting filters.

This filter determines whether or not a message processor should process an incoming event or message. You can use the On Unaccepted property to optionally specify a flow or subflow to handle any unaccepted events. Check the Throw On Unaccepted box to throw an exception if a message or event is not handled. The default when not checked is to not throw an exception.

*Note:* The flow or subflow that you specify does not return control to the parent flow.
