Following are tips for using Mule to communicate with .NET web services.

== Authentication and Other Security Features

There are three ways to secure a web service:

* <<Using an HTTP Web Server>>
* <<Using Authentication Tokens in SOAP Headers>>
* <<Using WS-Security>>

=== Using an HTTP Web Server

If you are running Mule on a Web App, you can configure the web server to use security by setting security configuration in `web.xml` and in the server's configuration file.

Alternatively, to secure a web service running on Mule (where Mule is the server), you can set the link:http://www.mulesoft.org/docs/site/3.7.0/apidocs/org/mule/module/acegi/filters/http/HttpBasicAuthenticationFilter.html[HttpBasicAuthenticationFilter] in the web service component. Any call made to the web service has to pass through the filter that delegates the authentication to Acegi.

Another alternative is to use HTTPS where certificates are used for authentication.

For more information see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/configuring-security[Configuring Security].

=== Using Authentication Tokens in SOAP Headers

You can send authentication tokens through SOAP headers as long as there is an authentication provider established that is able to understand the headers and perform the authentication.

=== Using WS-Security

If you are using CXF, you can configure a client and service to use WS-Security. For details, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/enabling-ws-security[Enabling WS-Security].

== Passing Authentication Information to a Web Service

There are three methods for passing authentication information to a web service configured on Mule:

* Pass them in the URL, such as with the `+http://name:password@localhost:8080/MyService+` value.
* Set the authentication items as properties when using the Mule client.
* Create headers containing the authentication items and send them as properties when using the Mule client.
