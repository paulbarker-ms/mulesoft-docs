Create custom notifications inside your flows and exception strategies, as well as manage actions and alerts in your CloudHub instance. Here we show you how to set up custom notifications.

Review the technical reference linked at top to learn how to manage applications and tenancies through the CloudHub connector.

== Installing

=== Install from Anypoint Exchange
To deploy, start, stop, and update applications as well as send notifications from your application to CloudHub, get the https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?type=connector&search=cloudhub[CloudHub connector] from Anypoint Exchange. 

=== Install from Studio

To access the CloudHub connector from Anypoint Studio, click *Help* > *Install New Software*. In *Work with*, click `Anypoint Connectors Update Site`. 

In the *Community* category, click *CloudHub Connector*. If this option is not listed, click *Help* > *Installation Details* and see if the connector was previously installed.

Click *Next* > then *Next* again > *I accept the terms of the license agreement*  > *Finish*, and restart Studio.

== Demo Configuration

Add and configure the CloudHub connector according to the basic setup in our link:/getting-started/deploy-to-cloudhub[Deploy to CloudHub tutorial].

. In Anypoint Studio, find the *CloudHub* connector on the right menu and then drag and drop it next to the *Set Payload* transformer:

+
. Open the configuration for the CloudHub connector. Create a new *Connector Configuration* for the connector by clicking the plus sign "*+*":
+

+
. For this demo, select *Basic Authentication* configuration, which must be configured with the corresponding *Username* and *Password*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
*Inherited Token Authentication* is a new configuration option that works only when your CloudHub connector's application is run inside a CloudHub instance. With this approach the connector retrieves the API Token from the CloudHub instance where the app is deployed.
+
. Enter your credentials into the configuration fields and click *OK*:
+

+
. Make sure that you have selected the *Create notification* operation and set the properties for:
.. *Domain*: This should be the domain you set for your application when you first created it following the link:/getting-started/deploy-to-cloudhub[Deploy to CloudHub tutorial].
.. *Message*: The message you want your notification to show (e.g. "_Your application has been hit_"). In the example below, the notification will simply display a "_Hello World!_" message.
.. *Priority*: The type of the notification. By selecting "INFO", your notification will display an informative message while selecting "ERROR" will display a red alert message.

+

+
. Additional information can be included with the notification by configuring the "Custom Properties" section.
[NOTE]
The expected "Custom Properties" format is `Map <String, String>` and is typically referenced using a bean or a variable where you have defined that map, for example, `\#[flowVars.magicMap]`,
or by defining a map using MEL `#[['key1':'value1']]`

. At this point, your application is set to be deployed and run. When your domain root is visited, the *Create notification* operation in the CloudHub connector creates a "Hello World!" notification message for the domain that the application is currently running on.

[IMPORTANT]
If you always want to create notifications on CloudHub, even when running locally, you can use the *Create notification* operation. This requires you to configure the connector with your username and password.

[NOTE]
The "Retrieve Logs" operation is no longer supported - to download logs use CH API or Anypoint CLI.
