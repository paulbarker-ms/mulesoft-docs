*Anypoint Connectors* facilitate easy integration of your Mule applications with third-party APIs and standard integration protocols. Use connectors within your application's flows to send and receive data using a protocol or specific API. 

== Installing

Anypoint Connectors are bundled with Anypoint Studio, and there is a large library of additional connectors available for download in https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?type=connector[Anypoint Exchange].

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for this connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

== Using a Connector

Import additional connectors into your Studio instance, or create applications using connectors outside of Studio by adding them as Maven dependencies or including connector libraries with your project.

The following shows the relationship of connectors to other components in the Anypoint Platform:
