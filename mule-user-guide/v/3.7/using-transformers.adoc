= Using Transformers
:keywords: anypoint studio, studio, mule, transformers

Transformers convert message payloads to formats expected by their destinations. Mule provides many standard transformers, which you configure using predefined elements and attributes in your Mule XML configuration file. You can also configure custom transformers using the `<custom-transformer>` element, in which you specify the fully qualified class name of the custom transformer class. For more information on creating and configuring a custom transformer, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/creating-custom-transformers[Creating Custom Transformers].

[TIP]
The most powerful tool for transforming a message is the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/dataweave[DataWeave Transformer], which can not only change the format of the message, but also rename, aggregate, split or rearrange the fields in it in any way you desire.

Standard transformers are easier to use than custom transformers. You don't need to know the Java name of the transformer, and all properties are explicitly declared in a Mule configuration schema. Following is an example of declaring the standard Append String transformer, which appends string text to the original message payload:

[source,xml]
----
<append-string-transformer name="myAppender" message=" ... that's good to know!"/>
----

If the original message payload was the string "foo", the transformer above would convert the string to "foo ... that's good to know!".

The <<Available Transformers>> section of this page describes all the standard transformers provided with Mule. Additionally, many link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/transports-reference[transports] and link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/modules-reference[modules] have their own transformers, such as the ObjectToJMSMessage transformer for the JMS transport.

== Configuring Transformers

You can configure a transformer _locally_ or _globally_. You configure a local transformer right on the endpoint or in a flow or where you want to apply it, whereas you configure a global transformer before any `<model>` or `<flow>` elements in your Mule configuration file and then reference it.

For example, the following code defines two global transformers, which are referenced from two different places:

[source,xml, linenums]
----
<xm:xml-to-object-transformer name="XMLToExceptionBean" returnClass="org.mule.example.errorhandler.ExceptionBean"/>
<custom-transformer name="ExceptionBeanToErrorMessage" class="org.mule.example.errorhandler.ExceptionBeanToErrorMessage"
returnClass="org.mule.example.errorhandler.ErrorMessage"/>
 
...
<flow name="Error Manager">
  <inbound-endpoint address="file://./test-data/in" transformer-refs="XMLToExceptionBean ExceptionBeanToErrorMessage">
    <file:filename-wildcard-filter pattern="*.xml" />
  </inbound-endpoint>
    ...
</flow>
...
<flow name="Business Error Manager">
  <inbound-endpoint address="jms://exception.queue"/>
  <transformer ref="XMLToExceptionBean"/>
  <transformer ref="ExceptionBeanToErrorMessage"/>
  ...
</flow>
----

== Chaining Transformers

You can chain transformers together so that the output from one transformer becomes the input for the next. To chain transformers, you create a space-separated list of transformers in the `transformer-refs` or `responseTransformer-refs` attributes or by creating multiple `<transformer>` elements as shown above.

For example, this chain ultimately converts from a ByteArray to InputStream:

[source, code, linenums]
----
transformer-refs="ByteArrayToString StringToObject ObjectToInputStream"
----

You could also configure this as follows:

[source,xml, linenums]
----
<transformer ref="ByteArrayToString"/>
<transformer ref="StringToObject"/>
<transformer ref="ObjectToInputStream"/>
----

Note that if you specify transformer chains, any default transformers or discoverable transformers are not applied. If you want to use those transformers, you must specify them explicitly with the other chained transformers.

== Transformation Best Practices

Mule has an efficient transformation mechanism. Transformers are applied to inbound or outbound endpoints, and the data is transformed just before it is sent or received from an endpoint. Transformers can be concatenated, so it is simple to perform multiple transformations on data in transit.

There is no one standard approach for how and where transformations should occur. Some maintain that because transformation should always be applied on inbound/outbound data, transformations should be available as part of the enterprise service bus instead of inside the components. This approach matches the concepts of Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). Others conclude that it is far more efficient to encode the transformation logic into the components themselves. In the second case, however, there is no distinction between code that is related to a business process and code that is generic enough to be reused, which contradicts the philosophy of a Mule.

While there is no industry best practice, MuleSoft recommends that developers examine their transformation logic to see if it always uses (AOP) or if it is specific to a business process. In general, if it always is used, you should use a transformer, and if it is specific to a single business process, it should be part of the component.

Note the following cases where you should *not* configure a transformer:

* Default transformers: some transports have default transformers that are called by default, but only if you don't configure explicit transformations.
* Discoverable transformers: some transformers can be discovered and used automatically based on the type of message. You do not configure these transformers explicitly. These include custom transformers that have been defined as discoverable. For more information, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/creating-custom-transformers[Creating Custom Transformers].

[source,xml, linenums]
----
<bean-builder-transformer name="testTransformer3" beanClass="org.mule.test.fruit.Orange">
  <bean-property property-name="brand" evaluator="mule" expression="message.payload" optional="true"/>
