The Anypoint Amazon S3 Connector provides connectivity to the the Amazon S3 API, enabling you to interface with Amazon S3 to store objects, download and use data with other AWS services, and build applications that call for internet storage. Instant access to the Amazon S3 API enables seamless integrations between Amazon S3 and other databases, CMS applications such as Drupal, and CRM applications such as Salesforce.

*Release Notes:* link:/release-notes/amazon-s3-connector-release-notes[Amazon S3 Connector Release Notes]

== Introduction

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. You can accomplish these tasks using the simple and intuitive web interface of the AWS Management Console.

The AWS SDK for Java provides a Java API for AWS infrastructure services. The Amazon S3 connector is built using the SDK for Java. For the complete list of operations supported by the connector, see http://mulesoft.github.io/mule-amazon-s3-connector/[Apidocs and Samples].

== Prerequisites

To use the Amazon S3 connector, you must have the following:

* Access to Amazon Web Services. 
* To access AWS with the connector, you need the credentials in the form of IAM.
* Anypoint Studio Enterprise edition.

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors], link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/index[Anypoint Studio Essentials]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/basic-studio-tutorial[Basic Studio Tutorial]. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/elements-in-a-mule-flow[Elements in a Mule Flow], link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/global-elements[Global Elements].

This document describes implementation examples within the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule’s graphical user interface, and also includes configuration details for doing the same in the XML Editor.

== Compatibility

Amazon S3 connector is compatible with:

[%header,cols="20a,80a",width=70%]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|3.5.0 or later
|AWS SDK for Java|1.9.39
|===

== Installing and Configuring

The following sections describe how to install and configure this connector.

=== Installing

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

The following updates are in version 3.0 of the Amazon S3 connector:

* Renamed the following operations:
** List object versions to List versions
** Set Bucket Versioning status to Set Bucket Versioning Configuration
* Removed the following operations:
** Create object uri

For most of the operations the input and output attributes have been modified.

=== Configuring the Global Element with Studio Visual Editor

To use the Amazon S3 connector in your Mule application, configure a global Amazon S3 element for use by all the Amazon S3 connectors in the application.

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas, then click *Create*.
. In the *Choose Global Type* window, expand *Connector Configuration*, and click *Amazon S3: Configuration*.
+
image:ams3_01.png[ams3_01]
+
. Click *Ok*
. Enter the global element properties:
+
image:ams3_02.png[ams3_02]
+
[%header,cols="30a,70a",width=80%]
|===
|Parameter|Description
|*Name*|Enter a name for the configuration to reference it.
|*Access Key*|Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account.
|*Secret Key*|Key that plays the role of a password.
|===
+
[NOTE]
In the image above, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the 
`src` folder of your project. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/configuring-properties[Learn how to configure properties].

You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ. See 
link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/deploying-to-multiple-environments[Deploying to Multiple Environments] for instructions on how to manage this.

. Keep the *Pooling Profile* and the *Reconnection tabs* with their default entries.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Amazon S3. Read more about this in  link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/testing-connections[Testing Connections].
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations. 

=== Configuring the Global Element with XML Editor

First, ensure that you have included the Amazon S3 namespaces in your configuration file.

Follow these steps to configure an Amazon S3 connector in your application:
Create a global Amazon S3 configuration outside and above your flows, using the following global configuration code.

|Parameter|Description
|*Name*|Enter a name for the configuration with which it can be referenced later by config-ref. The name in this example is `Amazon_S3_Configuration`.
|*accessKey*|The access key provided by Amazon. It is required for non-anonymous operations.
|*secretKey*|The secrete key provided by Amazon. It is required for non-anonynous operations.

+
image:ams3_08.png[ams3_08]
+
[%header,cols="30a,70a",width=80%]
|===
|Field|Value
|*Display Name*|Enter a name of your choice.
|*Connector Configuration*|Select the global configuration that you created.
|*Operation*|Create object
|*Bucket Name*|`${config.bucket}`
|*Key*|mulesoft.png
|*Content Reference*|`#[payload]`

=== Using XML 

For this code to work in Anypoint Studio, you must provide Amazon Web Services credentials. You can either replace the variables with their values in the code, or you can provide the values for each variable in the src/main/app/mule-app.properties file.
