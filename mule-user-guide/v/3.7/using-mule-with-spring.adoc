== Mule App XML Configuration File

link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/about-the-xml-configuration-file[About the XML Configuration File]

The most common way to configure Mule is with Spring XML files that use custom Mule namespaces.

Use one of the two namespaces in your spring framework schema in Mule:

* `+http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans+` `+http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-current.xsd+`
* `+http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans+` `+http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-current.xsd+`

== Spring Application Contexts

[TIP]
See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/spring-application-contexts[Spring Application Contexts]

Mule offers several options for creating and managing Spring application contexts for your application.

* Single application context
* Multiple application context
* Existing application context
* Existing application context as parent

Build Spring beans to define component behaviors which Mule applications can reference.

== Spring Bean Definition Profiles

Mule’s configuration file takes advantage of Spring 4.1's ability to create *bean definition profiles*. You can use Spring bean definition profiles to register different beans for different target environments, instead of using one bean for all target environments. Refer to link:http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.1.6.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/[Spring’s blog posting] for more information about bean definition profiles.
