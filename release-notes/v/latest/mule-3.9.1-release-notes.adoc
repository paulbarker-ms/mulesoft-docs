== New Features and Enhancements

Regarding API Gateway capabilities:

* This patch version ships with the OpenID Connect library missing on v3.9.0, which allows to use the out-of-the-box OpenID Connect oAuth 2.0 token enforcement policy.

* In the previous version, in the case of APIKit based Mule apps, only the root RAML was uploaded by API Autodiscovery when the API was created. Now the root RAML and the files specified in the include entries of the RAML, which are included in the Mule application in folders which are present in the root, are also uploaded.

* This version enhances analytics data with Host name information.

* Outage management is improved: Backoff behaviour and its corresponding logs, Gatekeeper behavior when initializing and Gatekeeper flexible mode logs on Cloudhub.

* Security fixes.

* DataWeave:
** Adds support for surrogated chars in UTF-8.
** Adds a new system property to control caches: `com.mulesoft.dw.mapping.cache.size` for mapping cache,  `com.mulesoft.dw.p_function.cache.size` to control `p` function cache.
** Supporting RFC 4180. Empty quotes are treated as empty values.
** Support for underflow and overflow.

* Mule as Websphere/Weblogic Custom Service
** New functionality was added to manage license keys in the default OS Java preferences location. This is used for effective license verification when Mule is deployed as a Mule Websphere Custom Service.

== Changes in This Release

* Disable TLS_RSA encryption ciphers as part of protection against the ROBOT attack (https://robotattack.org/)
* Remove Drools module from distribution (check the Drools doc for details in case you need to use it: https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/drools-module-reference)
