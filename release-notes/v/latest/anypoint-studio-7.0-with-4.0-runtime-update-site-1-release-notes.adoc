== Migration Guide

For first time installment, please refer to link:/release-notes/anypoint-studio-7.0-EA-with-4.0-runtime-release-notes[Anypoint Studio 7.0.0 EA with Mule Runtime 4.0.0 Release Notes] for hardware requirements and known issues.

Studio 7 only supports Mule 4 projects. The structure of the project, export format, xml and scripting language are different. +
Users must migrate Mule 3 projects to Mule 4 manually, before they can be used in Studio 7. See link:/mule4-user-guide/v/4.1/mule-4-changes[Mule Runtime 4.0 Changes] for a list of changes.

From the previous version of Studio 7.0 there is no special migration needed.
