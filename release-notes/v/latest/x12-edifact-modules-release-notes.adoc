== 1.3.0

*November 7, 2017*

===  Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule 3.6.0 and later
|===

=== Fixed Issues

* X12 corrected an error in formatting values for the ISA10 and GS05 time fields.
* X12 corrected a serialization-related error causing an exception scala.MatchError: None.
* EDIFACT changed parser to interpret UNOY syntax identifier as UTF-8 encoding by default, for consistency with writer code.

=== New Features

* X12 HIPAA support, including Type 1 and 2 validation.
* X12 error reporting - added information for error type (interchange, group, transaction, segment, or element) and interchange/group/transaction set identifiers; all error reports now included in the root level map.
* X12 now includes all versions from 003010 to 005050, and 006020.
* X12 added validateBeforeWrite configuration parameter to check for errors in data before writing to the output stream, instead of checking while the data is being written; if one or more fatal errors are found an exception is thrown from the write operation without any data being written.
* X12 added ackAllSets configuration parameter to generate a separate AK2/AK5 (997) or AK2/IK5 (999) acknowledgment for every transaction set; by default, only transaction sets with errors are specified in the acknowledgment.
* EDIFACT added receiveEncodingOverride configuration parameter to allow the user to specify the receive character encoding
* EDIFACT added support for UNOW syntax identifier in parser, interpreting this as UTF-8 encoding.

== 1.2.1

*September 28, 2016*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule 3.6.0 and later
|===

===  New Features

* Added support for inline components in ESL schema definitions.
* Added support for writing DataWeave-compatible types.
* Improved overlay handling, allowing segments to specify only modified components and change component type
* Support writing repeating composite.
* Add interchange information (with sender and receiver reversed) to X12 TA1 interchange acknowledgments generated by parsing.
* Support sending X12 messages with only TA1 interchange acknowledgments, no transaction data.

=== Fixed Issues

* Corrected some off-by-one errors in reporting data errors for both X12 and EDIFACT, and some segment off-by-one errors for EDIFACT.
* Changed loop/group keys in data, eliminating position numbers previously used at start of key.
* Corrected loop position tracking and reporting in X12 ACK3/IK3, ACK4/IK4 segments (997/999 functional acknowledgments).
* Correct check for data present when reading a composite to work correctly when first value of composite is empty.
* Abort parsing of EDIFACT message if the initial UNA/UNB cannot be read (since there's no way to know the delimiters being used for message).

== 1.0.0

*Sept 21, 2015*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule 3.6.0 and later
|===


=== New in This Release

This release contains many improvements, including:

* Support for reading/writing multiple versions of the same transaction type within a single message
* Additional EDIFACT message types d03A and d95B
* Improved structure usability with DataWeave and MEL by including "Loop" in the key name for loops and using underscores instead of spaces. You will need to update your integrations appropriately for this (see below).
* Improved validation logic on writing.
* Many bug fixes

link:/anypoint-b2b/[Anypoint B2B], link:/anypoint-b2b/edifact-module[EDIFACT Module], and link:/anypoint-b2b/x12-module[X12 Module].

=== Migration Guide

All of your transformations and expressions that references parts of the EDI message structure must be updated for the following changes:

* The "Transactions" list has been changed to "TransactionSets" and now has an additional level for the version of the transactions.
** Example: payload.Transactions."850" now becomes payload.TransactionSets.v5010."850"
* All keys no longer have spaces - instead they have underscores
** Example: payload."0100 PO1" becomes payload."0100_PO1"
* Any segment that is a loop
** Example: payload.Detail."0100 PO1" becomes payload.Detail."0100_PO1_Loop"

== Known Issues

The following issues apply to all versions:

* X12 binary segments are not supported, are not included in schema definitions, and cause errors.
* EDIFACT packages (containers for binary data) are not supported, and cause errors if you attempt to use them.
* EDIFACT interactive exchanges (using UIB header segment and UIZ trailer segment) are not supported.
* Code values are not currently verified for either reading or writing. (as of version 1.3.0, X12 HIPAA validation supports mandated code values)
* X12 syntax rules and EDIFACT dependency notes are not currently enforced for either reading or writing. (as of version 1.3.0, X12 HIPAA validation supports syntax rules)
* EDIFACT groups are not supported.
