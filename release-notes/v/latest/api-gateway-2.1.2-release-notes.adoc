= API Gateway Runtime 2.1.2 Release Notes
:keywords: api gateway, connector, release notes

API Gateway Rutime 2.2.1 includes bug fixes and the following enhancements:

* Two new block definitions on the policies are defined: After and Before exception blocks. 
+
Similar to the functionality of HTTP after and before blocks, these blocks enhance the catch exception strategy of a flow without the need to modify it.
+
* Increased security by upgrading Gatekeeper to v2.0.
+
The enhancements include cluster support with improved performance, zero security gaps while the feature is in active mode, and small improvements in runtime startup when the feature is in active mode. Several corner cases have been fixed.
+
* Several security risks are addressed, including XXe vulnerability.
+
* Throttling algorithm improvements backported from v3.8.3. Old algorithm can be used instead of the new one by specifying the following system properties: `throttling.compatibility_enabled`
+
* Performance improvements.
