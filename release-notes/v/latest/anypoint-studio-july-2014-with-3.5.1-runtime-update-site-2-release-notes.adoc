== Improvements

* Fixed a bug in Maven Support which caused the classpath not to be updated if the user edited the pom.xml file manually in some cases (STUDIO-5363). 
* Fixed a performance issue that would end up in the properties editor taking a long time to render. 
* Fixed metadata generation for some BAPIs that represented corner cases in SAP (field names with special characters). 
* Fixed a bug with the numberOfConsumers attribute in the ActiveMQ connector which would cause it to disappear. 
* Fixed an issue which would cause the General tab of the CXF element not to be drawn (STUDIO-5340). 
* Fixed a bug regarding Batch references or Flow references when the referencing element is in a file located in a different folder than the referenced element (STUDIO-5343) . 
* Fixed a bug regarding data mapping which would cause the pipe delimiter not to be respected if it was the original separator when providing an example (STUDIO-5337). 
* Fixed an issue with User defined Lookup Tables in DataMapper (STUDIO-5367) 
* Fixed an issue with BigDecimal precision in DataMapper that would cause it to default to 2 d.p. +

[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.
