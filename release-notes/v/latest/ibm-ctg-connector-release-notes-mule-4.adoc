The IBM CICS Transaction Gateway (IBM CTG) connector provides integration with back-end CICS applications using the CICS Transaction Gateway. For Java platforms, CTG implements the JCA resource adapter to connect Java applications to the CICS system.
The connector serves as a handrail between Mule applications and the CTG.

== 1.0.2

*January 19, 2018*

IBM CICS Transactions Gateway (IBM CTG) connector is available in Mule 4.0.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime |4.0 and later
|Java | 8
|IBM CICS TG (for Multiplatforms and for z/OS) |9.1 and 9.2
|IBM CICS TG SDK |9.1 and 9.2
|===

Notes:

* The remote CICS TG must be at the same or a higher release level than the version of the JCA resource adapter.
* The JCA resource adapter must match the CICS TG platform. For example, if you have CICS TG for Multiplatforms, you cannot connect to it from a CICS TG with the z/OS resource adapter.

The following JAR files are required to set up a connector configuration:

* ccf2.jar (CICS Common Connector Framework)
* cicsjee.jar (CICS JEE)
* ctgclient.jar (CTG Client Library)
* ctgserver.jar (CTG Server Library)
* geronimo-j2ee-connector_1.6_spec-1.0.jar (JCA 1.6 Specification)
+
Note: JCA 1.6 is needed as a required library to overcome conflicts with JCA 1.5 shipped with the Mule Runtime.

=== Features

* Authentication - The connector uses, under the hood, the IPIC (IP interconnectivity) protocol to establish communication with CICS regions over TCP/IP. This type of client also supports SSL authentication.
* Execution of CICS Programs - The connector allows users to invoke CICS programs in two manners:
** Using Channels and Containers.
** Using a COMMAREA. Data transfers are limited to 32 KB.
* Transactions - The connector leverages XA Transactions by means of Mule's Transactional scope and the Bitronix Transaction Manager components.
* DataSense - The connector supports adding metadata using through the Custom Metadata Tab option. Using the Copybook feature, a user can import a schema that describes the data structure going in and out of CTG so as to be used by a DataWeave component.

=== Known Issues

* Although the inclusion of JCA 1.6 as a required library is meant to solve compatibility conflicts with the JCA 1.5 shipped with the Mule Runtime, it is yet unknown if this causes side effects.
