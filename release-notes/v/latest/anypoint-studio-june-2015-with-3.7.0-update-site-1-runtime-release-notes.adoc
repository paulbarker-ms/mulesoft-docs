=== Migration Guide

This section presents configuration considerations you may want to adjust when migrating from a previous version of a Mule runtime, or previous version of Studio. Contact MuleSoft if you have a question about a specific migration activity or concern.

* Mule ESB 3.7.0 is supported from Anypoint Studio June 2015 Release and onwards. Older Mule ESB runtimes can also be installed in the new Anypoint Studio release.
* APIkit 1.5.1 only works in runtimes whose versions are less than 3.6.0. APIkit 1.6.0 works in the 3.6.0 runtime and above (see JIRA STUDIO-5955).
* Java 7 is required for Anypoint Studio. If you are deploying to Java 6 runtimes, you can continue to configure Java 6 as the Java runtime for your project. *Note*: If you are installing Anypoint Studio on a new computer or a fresh installation, you must also download and install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html[JDK 1.6], which provides important libraries for later JDK versions. Install JDK 1.6 first and then install JDK 1.7. *Note*: If you are installing Anypoint Studio on a new computer or a fresh installation, you must also download and install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html[JDK 1.6], which provides important libraries for later JDK versions. Install JDK 1.6 first and then install JDK 1.7.
* If you wish to install a previous runtime or a community runtime, follow the instructions to add additional runtimes to your new instance of Studio.
* From the previous versions of Studio (5.1.1, 5.2.0) there is no special migration needed, but when coming from older versions, it's recommended that you create a new workspace to host projects built with this new version. When opening a previous Workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project. Note that performing this conversion might imply loosing previously defined run configurations.

[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.

Then specify the location of your old version of Anypoint Studio in your local drive.

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

* The 3.7.0 release does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by the 3.6.1 Runtime.

* MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4 GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM. https://www.mulesoft.com/support-and-services/mule-esb-support-license-subscription[Contact MuleSoft Support] with any questions you have about system requirements.

== Deprecated in this Release

* Nothing was deprecated in this release.
