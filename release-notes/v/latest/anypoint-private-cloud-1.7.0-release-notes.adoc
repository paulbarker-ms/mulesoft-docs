| Deploying applications to Pivotal Cloud Foundry directly from Runtime Manager is not supported in this release. You can still deploy applications to PCF using the Mule Runtime Buildpack.
| In rare cases where AWS adds a new AZ for region where cluster is running, rerunning terraform might have unpredictable results. | If you need to re-run Terraform, carefully review the execution plan before confirming.
