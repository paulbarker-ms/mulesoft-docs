== Known Issues

* Some existing features in Studio 6.x are not yet supported in Studio 7: Domains, Custom Policies, API Sync, Anypoint Private Cloud, Gateway runtime connectivity.
* To be able to deploy a project which uses the runtime 4.0.0 into Cloudhub you need to have certain permissions in your Anypoint Platform user to see runtime 4.0.0 when deploying it.
* Anypoint Studio uses your configured default browser to display web content such as Exchange and the Runtime Manager UI when deploying an application to Anypoint Platform. If your default internet browser does not display this content correctly, you can configure Anypoint Studio to use a Mozilla/XULRunner runtime environment as the underlying renderer for the Web UI. +
Follow the link:/anypoint-studio/v/7/faq-default-browser-config[FAQ: Troubleshooting Issues with Your Default OS Browser] for more details.
* When referencing a RAML spec using Json Schema draft 3, DataSense fails.
* DataSense does not work for connectors not shipped with Studio.
* Menu items get grayed out after opening Exchange using XulRunner.
* Mule modules needs to provide icons, today many of the modules have the generic icon.
* Running application "Pom.xml" is not updated when changing dependencies.
* DW script errors related to schemas validations don't have the line location of the error.
* DW: Copybook to Copybook mapping doesn't work.
* Metadata propagation does not work when the root file is stored in src/test/resources.
* Test Connection in HTTP Request / SMTP are throwing false positives.
* Metadata: Actual and Expected metadata are being shown even when it's the same type.
* Debugger: payload shown while debugging is partial but there is no way to view the rest of the payload.
* When referencing a RAML spec using Json Schema draft 3, DataSense fails.
* Mule plugins with snapshot versions should always be regenerated.

== Migration Guide

Studio 7 only supports Mule 4 projects. The structure of the project, export format, xml and scripting language are different. +
Users must migrate Mule 3 projects to Mule 4 manually, before they can be used in Studio 7. See the Mule migration guide for more information.
