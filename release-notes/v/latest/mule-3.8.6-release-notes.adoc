* As part of disaster recovery initiative, Gatekeeper enhancements introduced in v3.9.0 are backported to this version. Gatekeeper default level is now “flexible”.

* Some fixes regarding ARM, performance, and recovery from lost connectivity scenarios.

* In this release, CORS module is upgraded to v2.1.3. HTTP Client is upgraded to v4.5.3 and Jackson library is upgraded to v2.9.2.

== Changes
