== 2.1.0

*October 27, 2017*

New features release.

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime | Mule Runtime Enterprise Edition 3.7.0 and later
|Apache Kafka | 0.10.2.0
|===

=== Features

* Added topic-offset initial configuration to the consumer. New optional field "partitionOffsetsMEL (Partition Offsets MEL) has been added to the consumer source. You have to provide a MEL expression that evaluates to a `Map<String, String>` that has a partition number as key and offset for that partition as value. For example, `#[["0":"3", "1": "4"]]` means that the consumer starts to consume from partition 0 starting at offset 3 and from partition 1 starting at offset 4.
* Added inboundProperties containing information for the topic, partition, offset, and key to a message returned by consumer.

== 2.0.1

*August 25, 2017*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime | Mule Runtime Enterprise Edition 3.7.0 and later
|Apache Kafka | 0.10.2.0
|===

=== Fixed in this Release

* Too many open files open Error. In  previous versions when using an external property location for producer properties, a `Too many files open` error appeared when the same number of requests were sent as the file limit on the machine. Now, it works as expected.
* Kafka client exceptions lost by Kafka consumer operation. In previous versions, the Kafka client exceptions were lost and so the errors were not being reported back to the connector, and not reporting a `not consumed message`. Now the connector reports the error as expected.
* Unhandled exceptions when using the Kafka Connector in a synchronous flow. When using the connector in synchornous flow , exceptions were not handled and the flow didn't go into the Exception Strategy. Now the exceptions are handled and the flow goes to the Exception Strategy as expected.
