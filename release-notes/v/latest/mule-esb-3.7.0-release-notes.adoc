=== DataWeave Language and Transformer

This release introduces a new language, called DataWeave, which is a simple, powerful way to query and transform data inside of Mule. It provides JSON-like language that's purposefully built to make writing transformations as fast as possible and highly maintainable over the long term. It supports a variety of transformations, from simple 1 to 1 mappings, to more elaborate mappings including normalization, grouping, joins, partitioning, pivoting and filtering. 

The language is tightly integrated with Mule ESB and Anypoint Studio. There is a DataWeave Transformer that allows you to use the language to query and transform data. It fully supports DataSense, allowing you to leverage metadata from connectors, schemas and sample documents to more easily design your transformations. DataSense provides content assist while you are coding and scaffolds your mappings to help make writing transformations fast and easy. The editor also provides real time feedback as you code, processing sample inputs into sample outputs that are constantly updated as you write your transform.

DataWeave replaces our current DataMapper component as our recommended way of doing data transformation. It comes with a number of advantages over DataMapper, including:

* Support for more complex transformations
* Improved performance
* Better error reporting
* Support for multiple inputs
* Support for larger than memory payloads
* Random access to input documents

Currently there are some features of DataMapper that DataWeave does not yet support and which will be addressed in future releases, including:

* A graphical drag and drop editor for creating DataWeave transforms 
* Excel support

DataMapper continues to be fully supported in all current and future versions of Mule 3.x. 

=== Non-Blocking Processing Strategies

A new non-blocking processing strategy for HTTP proxy scenarios. This enables higher API scalability with minimal tuning inside the runtime. To support this, there is also a new direct threading profile and a new configuration option to set the default threading profile on the <configuration> element.

Not all Mule components fully support non-blocking operations. 

=== HTTP Connector

The HTTP connector contains may additional security options for the request element, including:

* NTLM authentication support
* Preemptive authentication support
* SNI support   

=== Additional Improvements

* Set payload, set-variable, set-property and set-session-variable now support setting the mimeType and encoding.
* Support for custom serializers and a new Kryo serializer which boosts performance for HA, VM Queues and ObjectStore
* Connect to databases dynamically by using MEL expressions in the database configuration
* WS-Consumer support for signing and encrypting payloads with WS-Security
* Many internal libraries have been upgraded, most notably Spring has been upgraded to Spring 4.1.6 and CXF has been upgraded to 2.7.15.
* Java 8 is now an officially supported runtime, in addition to Java 7
*  Lifecycle improvements: the object lifecycle is now applied on registered objects in the correct order, taking into account both object types and declared dependencies. Also, dependency injection is now supported on all registered objects as defined by JSR-330. Non registered objects can also be injected through the new Injector API. For more information, see Lifecycle Improvements in the Migration Guide section.
* More than 100 bug fixes

== Bundled Runtime Manager Agent

This version of Mule ESB comes bundled with the Runtime Manager Agent Plugin version 1.1.0.

== Migration Guide

DataMapper is now an optional plugin that must be installed inside the Mule runtime for applications that are using it.

MULE-8583 also introduced hostname validation in the HTTP requester since the upgrade included the fix for link:https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/197[this] async-http-client security vulnerability. This means that seemingly valid certificates for HTTPS connections in older versions could now be rejected if they contain no Subject Alternative Name extension matching the host of the request.

|MULE-8340 |TLS configuration is not mapped anymore to the default JVM system properties. In order to keep this behavior, define the following system property: mule.tls.disableSystemPropertiesMapping=false
|MULE-8367 |Property http.relative.path was added to the inbound properties of the HTTP listener. This property reflects the value of the http.request.path property without the basePath part of the corresponding listener.
|MULE-7588 a|
Lifecycle has been fixed. Please have the following considerations:

* Initializable objects invoke only after the registry has instantiated all objects and successfully injected dependencies into them. initialize() is no longer eagerly invoked.
* JSR-330 annotations are now the recommended way of getting hold of dependencies. Manual lookups through the mule context registry are still supported but not recommended.
* Initialization is now applied on dependency order, meaning that if object 'A' depends on 'B' and 'C', Mule guarantees that by the time that 'A' is initialized, 'B' and 'C' have already been initialized. Note that for this to work, to dependency has to be explicitly expresses through the javax.inject.Inject annotation or through a Spring configuration.
* TransientRegistry is deprecated and no longer used by the runtime. SpringRegistry is now the only registry the runtime uses by default. AbstractMuleContextTestCase uses the new SimpleRegistry instead.
* addRegistry() and removeRegistry() methods from the MuleContext have been deprecated. Manually added registries cannot participate in dependency injection.
* The org.mule.api.registry.Registry.registerObject(key, Object, metadata) method has been deprecated. The metadata is no longer used.
* RegistryBroker and RegistryBrokerLifecycleManager classes have been deprecated.
* SimpleRegistryBootstrap is deprecated and is no longer used by the runtime. SpringRegistryBootstrap is used instead.
* PreInjectProcessor, InjectProcessor, ObjectProcessor and all their implementation have been deprecated and are no longer used by the runtime. Use a Spring BeanPostProcessor instead.
* Spring's init-method and destroy-method are no longer recommended when defining Spring beans that implement any of the Mule Lifecycle interfaces (Initialisable, Startable, Stoppable, Disposable)
* Class org.mule.config.bootstrap.SimpleRegistryBootstrap.ArtifactType was moved to org.mule.config.bootstrap.ArtifactType
* Spring Bean Definition parsers no longer automatically call the initialize() and dispose() methods. If you want to maintain that behavior in your custom parsers, you must explicitly do it yourself.
* An example of doing that would be:

[source,json,linenums]
----
private void setInitAndDisposeMethods(BeanDefintionBuilder builder, Class<?> parsedObjectType) {

   if (Initialisable.class.isAssignableFrom(parsedObjectType)) {
      builder.setInitMethodName(Initialisable.PHASE_NAME);
   }

   if (Disposable.class.isAssignableFrom(parsedObjectType)) {
       builder.setDestroyMethodName(Disposable.PHASE_NAME);
   }
}
----

* For further technical details, you can read the full spec at https://github.com/mulesoft/mule/wiki/%5BMule-3.7.0-M1%5D-Registry-Consolidation,-Lifecycle-fix,-and-Dependency-Injection

|MULE-8430 |
In previous versions of Mule, domain home folders where created relative to current working directory instead of relative to <MULE_HOME> folder.

Now that this is fixed, if your Mule instance was started from a folder other than <MULE_HOME> then folder <WORKING_DIRECTORY>/.mule/<DOMAIN_NAME> must be moved to <MULE_HOME>/.mule/<DOMAIN_NAME>

|MULE-8457 |
set-payload element is now implemented using a plain MessageProcessor instead of using a MessageTransformer. This means that <set-payload> continues working as before unless it is used as a transformer. (For example, inside an endpoint.)

To use SetPayloadTransformer in the Mule configuration file as a transformer, define it as a <custom-transformer> like this:

[source, xml,linenums]
----
<custom-transformer class="org.mule.transformer.simple.SetPayloadTransformer">
    <spring:property name="value" value="someValue"/>
 </custom-transformer>
----

|MULE-8469 |
Applying a message transformer does not changes message's data type if the payload was not replaced during the transformation.

In particular, this changes affects usages of message properties transformer configured like this:

[source, xml,linenums]
----
<message-properties-transformer name="setResponseType" mimeType="text/baz" encoding="UTF-16BE"/>
----

That now must be configure in this way:

[source, xml,linenums]
----
<message-properties-transformer name="setResponseType">
<add-message-property key="Content-Type" value="text/baz;charset=UTF-16BE"/>
</message-properties-transformer>
----

Or like this:

[source, xml,linenums]
----
<set-property propertyName="Content-Type" value="text/baz;charset=UTF-16BE"/>
----

|MULE-8498 |
Applying a message transformer that changes message's payload updates the message data type, but instead of using transformer's output data type, it uses a merge between payload's and transformer data types.

If a transformer's output data type does not provide a MIME type and/or encoding, then the original payload data type MIME type and/or encoding is used. This can cause different transformers to be applied to an application after the upgrade. In case there is a failure, use <set-payload> to set encoding and the MIME type while maintaining the same payload.

|MULE-7990
a|
A new API for object serialization has been added through the ObjectSerializer interface. Use the following considerations:

* If you were manually using the org.mule.util.SerializationUtils class in custom components, scripts or flows, you should use this API instead.
* In the same way, where you were before catching a org.apache.commons.lang.SerializationException you should now expect a org.mule.api.serialization.SerializationException
* You can now specify which is the default implementation of ObjectSerializer that you want your application to use. Such instances are used by Mule (although you're free to use others in your custom code). By default, the ObjectSerializer implementation uses default Java serialization an behaves exactly the same as in prior versions.
* To configure your custom serializer as the default you can use the <configuration> tag:

[source, xml,linenums]
----
<configuration defaultObjectSerializer-ref="myCustomSerializer" />
----

* There are many ways to obtain an ObjectSerializer. Recommended approach is through dependency injection. The following shows how to get the ObjectSerializer that has been configured as the default:

[source,java,linenums]
----
public class MyClass {

@Inject
@DefaultObjectSerializer
private ObjectSerializer objectSerializer;

}
----

* Instead, if you want a specific named serializer (whether it's the default or not) you can also do it like this:

[source,java,linenums]
----
public class MyClass {

@Inject
@Named("mySerializer")
private ObjectSerializer objectSerializer;

}
----

* Finally, you can always pull it from the muleContext but dependency injection is preferred:

[source,java,linenums]
----
// returns the default object serializer
 muleContext.getObjectSerializer();

 // returns a named object serializer
 muleContext.getRegistry().get("mySerializer")

|MULE-8510 |setting a message property/variable with the message's payload when it is NullPayload removes the given property/variable instead of storing NullPayload.
|MULE-8483 |MULE_ENCODING and Content-Type properties are not added on the outbound scope when message encoding or mimeType are updated. This was done in order to maintain consistency on MuleMessage data type and properties.
 In case any of these properties is needed, use <set-property> indicating the expected value.
|MULE-8592 |Default maximum permanent generation has been increased to 256 mb. This property is only used when using Java 7. When using Java 8 the property may lead to a warning. In such case it can be comment out in the wrapper.conf file.
|MULE-8569

For those with custom implementation of class org.mule.config.spring.SpringXmlConfigurationBuilder, some important changes have been made:

* The method createApplicationContext(MuleContext, ConfigResource[]) is now private. If you want to overwrite it, use doCreateApplicationContext(MuleContext, ConfigResource[], OptionalObjectsController) instead.
* If you want to intercept and change the list of resources to be loaded, override the new addResources(List<ConfigResource>) method

|MULE-8645 |jasper-jdt-6.0.29 is not included anymore on Mule distributions because of detected vulnerabilities. In case this artifact is needed, when using Drools for example, manually add it to <MULE_HOME>/lib/opt
|MULE-8641 |The wrapper.conf file now contains default garbage collection and memory settings configured to improve performance in an environment with 2 GB+ memory. If you need to run Mule with less memory, edit this file.
|MULE-8628 a|
The HTTP connector now ignores its own custom properties (http.* ones) when sending a request and when responding to one, instead of transforming them to headers.

This means that:

* Properties generated by a listener won't affect a subsequent request
* Properties generated by that request won't affect the listener response
* If such properties are desired, they should be explicitly added as headers using a response/request builder

|MULE-8660 |AbstractMessageReceiver.routeMessage(..) no longer return nulls if the endpoint exchange pattern is one-way. It always returns the result of the flow so if a transaction commit fails the exception strategy is executed using the message result of the flow execution. Custom message receivers implementations may need to be updated.
