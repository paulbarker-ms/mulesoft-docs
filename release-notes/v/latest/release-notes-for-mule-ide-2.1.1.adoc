:keywords: release notes, mule, ide

== Hot Deployment Builder

The main feature of this release is the new <<Hot Deployment Builder>>. It allows you to deploy your application to Mule each time you build your project. In combination with Eclipse's auto build this makes a powerful feature, just save your classes or Mule configuration and hot deploy will kick in. While the builder works it still has some rough edges. Make sure you know about its current limitations before you file an issue.

== Project Decorator

Mule projects show a small overlay image in the Package Explorer now. This lets you distinguish your Mule projects better from regular Java projects.
