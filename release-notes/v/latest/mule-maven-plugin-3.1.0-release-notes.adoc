= Mule Maven Plugin 3.1.0 Release Notes

Mule Maven Plugin 3.1.0 is the first iteration after our major release of Mule Maven Plugin 3. +
We have manage to fix a small number of issues that were affecting the product and also added several key features that were intentionally left out of Mule Maven Plugin 3.0.0.

== Hardware and Software Requirements

Hardware and Software Requirements

* Microsoft Windows 8 \+
* Apple Mac OS X 10.10 \+
* Linux (tested on Ubuntu 15)
* Java 8
* Maven 3.3.3, 3.3.9, 3.5.0

== Compatibility

* Mule 4.x
* Anypoint Studio 7.x

== Features and Functionality

The first new feature we added is Domain Support. +
You can now package and deploy Mule Domains in the same way you did with the rest of the artifacts.

There is a new artifact type, the `mule-domain-bundle`. This new artifact is a ZIP file (not a JAR file as all the other artifacts). +
A mule domain bundle is a project with a pom.xml file which list dependencies to a Mule Domain artifact and at least one Mule Application. When packaged this artifact contains the JAR files of the Domain and all related Mule Applications. It will also run several validation cross dependencies to ensure not only that the Applications and the Domains are properly related but also to ensure no dependency conflict exists.

We’ve create the _muleExclude file. This file contains a list of paths and regular expressions that instruct the Mule Maven Plugin to ignore certain files when attaching the source code to the generated artifact.

Finally we’ve added a number of extra validations to ensure that we stop any problem with the artifact beforehand, thus avoiding time wasting in deployments that will fail.
