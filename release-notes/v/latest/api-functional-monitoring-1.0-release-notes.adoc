= API Functional Monitoring 1.0 Release Notes

This release of API Functional Monitoring introduces a new user interface that is incorporated into Anypoint Monitoring. To access this user interface, select *Functional Monitoring* after opening Anypoint Monitoring.

For documentation about this new user interface, see link:/api-functional-monitoring/afm-in-anypoint-platform[API Functional Monitoring in Anypoint Monitoring].

You can still create tests and schedule them using the BDD Test-Writing Language and the Blackbox Automated Testing (BAT) CLI. The documentation for doing that is located at link:/api-functional-monitoring/bat-top[API Functional Monitoring with the Blackbox Automated Testing (BAT) CLI].
