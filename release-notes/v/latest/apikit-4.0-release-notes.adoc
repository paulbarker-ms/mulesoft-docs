= APIkit Mule4-1.0.0 Release Notes

*November 19, 2017*

These release notes briefly describe changes, known issues, and limitations in APIkit Mule4-1.0.0.

== Whatâ€™s New

* Performance improvements have been achieved through the support of a non-blocking strategy for APIKit operations.
* API Console no longer appears in Studio. The URL for launching the Console appears in the logs in Studio when you create an APIkit API. To launch the Console, enter the URL in a browser.
* You can now configure APIkit Router properties to link:/apikit/v/4.x/validate-4-task[enable or disable the validations] of query parameters and headers. 
* APIkit now processes the operations declared after the APIkit router component.
* Only one of two 3.x-supported methods of configuring the Console is supported in this release.
* You can configure the Console only from within the apikit:config element.
* Retrieving the RAML is supported from the Console, but not from the API.
* Generated XML code differs from that generated by APIkit 3.x. The XML code complies with new Mule 4.0 components as shown in the following snippets:
