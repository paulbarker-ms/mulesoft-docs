[IMPORTANT]
Starting with v.3.0.0, the Zuora Connector is licensed commercially with Anypoint Platform as with other link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/anypoint-connectors#connector-categories[_Select_] connectors. Prior versions will remain freely available to the community.

== 3.1.1

*August 25, 2017*

=== Compatibility

The Zuora connector 3.1.1 is compatible with the following applications:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule Enterprise Edition 3.7.3 and later
|Zuora|v75
|===

=== Fixes

* *Invalid ConnectionTimeout and ReadTimeout configuration parameters:* Previously, when the ConnectionTimeout or the
ReadTimeout fields were set, they didn't affect the client and had no effect whatsoever. This led to having
SocketTimeoutExceptions when running particularly long operations or not having them when the expected timeout was set
to be short. Now they are working correctly and the timeouts happen when expected.

== 3.1.0

=== Compatibility

The Zuora connector 3.1.0 is compatible with the following applications:

* Added *Check Import Status* processor that receives an import URL as input and returns the status of the input.
* Added Multi-Entity support for Multi-Entity API for the REST operations https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity[Multi Entity API].
* Added connectTimeout and readTimeout fields in the connector configuration to increase the connection time and the time to wait for a response from the server.
* Added SocketTimeoutException, ConnectTimeoutException, SocketException and ConnectException to the list of exceptions that trigger a reconnection.
* Added  *Query* processor with support for both *DataSense Query Language* and *Native Query Language*.
* Added support for Aqua API https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/Aggregate_Query_API[Zuora Aqua API]. Besides the processors that
expose the Aqua API operations, to periodically check the status of a Aqua job and
retrieve its batches when it is complete, you can use the *Aqua post query* processor and *Aqua get batch results* source. For
more details on how to use these processors, consult the connector guide link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/zuora-connector[Zuora Connector].
