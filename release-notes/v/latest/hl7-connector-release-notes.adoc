= HL7 EDI Connector Release Notes

*January 2018*

_Premium_  

== 3.1.0

*January 3, 2018*

Version 3.1.0 provides bug fixes and greatly improved usability.

HL7 EDI Connector v3.1.0 is compatible with the following:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Application/Service |Version
|Mule Runtime |3.6.0 and later
|Anypoint Studio |5.0.0 and later
|HL7 |v2.1, v2.2, v2.3.1, v2.3, v2.4, v2.5, v2.5.1, v2.6, 2.7, 2.7.1, 2.8, 2.8.1
|===

=== New Features

* Separate sets of schemas for lax validation (all data elements treated as strings; length, repetition count, and usage restrictions not enforced).
* Drops numeric prefixes used on segment keys.
* Uses MSH segment definition from (first) configured schema.
* Allows configuration of ACK message schema.
* Provides a tool to generate a simplified schema definition based on one or more sample documents.

=== Fixed in this Release

* Apply configured character encoding when writing.
* Throw an exception when the wrong data type is found when writing (previously just stopped the write).
* Correct handling of message structure segment groups with optional leading segments.
* Correct handling of choice groupings of segments.

=== Backward Compatibility

Version 3.0.0 always used numeric position prefixes on segment keys (such as "01_MSH"). This has been disabled by default in 3.1.0, so that the segment key is normally just the segment tag (modified with a numeric suffix, if necessary because the segment is used in multiple locations within the same level of the message structure). For compatibility with 3.0.0 mappings you can turn off the "Disable numeric prefixes for data keys" configuration option (`identKeys="false"`).

=== Known Issue

* The `validateHL7Version` configuration option is not working and results in a NullPointerException when trying to read a message with this option enabled.

== 3.0.0

*January 6, 2017*
