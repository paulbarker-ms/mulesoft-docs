== 1.4.6 June 16, 2018

This release includes new features, enhancements, fixed issues, and known issues for designing Mule applications.

=== New Features and Enhancements

* When you select the option to restart your workspace, you will be asked to give your reason for doing so. Your responses will help MuleSoft assess the stability of the user interface.
* You can now rename the operations that are displayed on cards the Choice, For Each, Transform, and Try components.
* The error messages related to running and deploying applications are improved.
* If you do not reopen an existing project for five days, the worker for it is terminated. In past releases, when you reopened a project after that amount of time, a new worker was not provisioned for the project until you opened a card, which could cause longer than expected wait times for the values in the card to appear. Now, when you reopen a project 5 days after last using it, a new worker is provisioned for the project immediately.
* The navigation bar at the top of the screen has been redesigned to improve the experience of running and deploying applications.

=== Fixed Issues

* The panel that shows the log for an application now expands and collapses more smoothly.
* The MIME Type and Encoding options on the Set Payload and Set Variable cards are now removed and the values are set to the appropriate defaults.

=== Known Issues
The known issues that were in the 1.4.5 release continue into this release:

* Rest Connect connectors display their `artifactId`, instead of their name.
* The option to set an expression for repeated elements is temporarily disabled because this option is not currently supported by the DataWeave API.
* In some cases, the list of items in drop-down fields extends below the boundary of the current card, as in this image:
+
image:dc-menu-problem.png[]
* If you use 5.1.33 or later versions of the MySQL driver in a Database connector, your Mule application might run out of memory.

== 1.4.5 May 31, 2018

This release includes new features, enhancements, resolved issues, and known issues for designing Mule applications.

=== New Features and Enhancements

* An improved algorithm for mapping suggestions in the Transform component.
* Support for the Set Payload and Set Variable components.
* Automatic naming of flows created by the Getting Started wizard. For example, if you use the wizard to create a flow with the following components:
  ** Trigger: An HTTP component with _Listener_ selected as its operation
  ** Target: A Database component with _Insert_ selected as its operation

+
then, the default name for your flow is _HTTP listener to Database insert_.
* Support for renaming the operations that are displayed on cards. On a card, open the actions menu by clicking the three-dots icon and then select *Rename Card*. This option is not present on these cards: Choice, For Each, Transform, Try.
* Automatic selection of the latest driver type for the selected connection type in the Database connector. When you open the *Database Drivers* dialog to select a database driver, the latest version is automatically selected after you click the arrow in the selection field.

=== Fixed Issues

* Several bugs in functioning of the Transform card were fixed.
* Several minor bugs in user interface were fixed.

=== Known Issues
The known issues that were in the 1.4.0 release continue to be in this release:

* Rest Connect connectors display their `artifactId`, instead of their name.
* The option to set an expression for repeated elements is temporarily disabled because this option is not currently supported by the DataWeave API.
* In some cases, the list of items in drop-down fields extends below the boundary of the current card, as in this image:
+
image:dc-menu-problem.png[]
* If you use 5.1.33 or later versions of the MySQL driver in a Database connector, your Mule application might run out of memory.

=== 1.0 - July 29, 2017


This release includes the new web-based Design Center that enables you to easily create web-based integration flows, design API specifications, and create reusable API fragments.

==== Flow designer

With release you can:

* Create and manage Mule application projects.
* Design flows using a simple step-by-step process with the ability to quickly navigate to Exchange to see more information.
* Connect to systems and protocols using different connectors, including databases, FTP, HTTP, SOAP web services, Salesforce, Workday, and others.
* Support for REST connect, which provides a connector in the component selector for every API that is published in Exchange. This enables you to discover APIs as part of your design process and consume them without having to know the details of how the API works.
* Perform complex data transformations using DataWeave with a visual drag-and-drop editor.
* View live data, so you can easily debug your flows.
* Create and manage data types for XML, JSON, CSV, and objects.
* Control the flow of data:
** Choice Router enables you to make logical decisions and route to specific event processors or other flows.
** For Each Scope enables you to loop over payload content.
** Try Scope enables you to incorporate error-handling logic into your flows. Using error handlers, you can select specific error types that could occur, and define a behavior to deal with each.
** Flow Refs enable you to call out to other flows from your main flow.
* Store and retrieve information from the Mule Object Store.
* Use design environments, which enable you to develop applications using flow designer, without consuming your Sandbox vCores.
* Manage dependencies, so you can control the versions of your connectors and modules, to upgrade or downgrade at any time.

Underpinning this release is the initial release of Mule 4.0 Runtime. This release is currently only available to Design Center users. More details on what’s new in Mule 4 can be found in the Mule Runtime section.


==== API designer

This release of Design Center enables you to:

* Edit RAML API specifications and fragments.
* Publish and consume reusable API fragments, so that common best practices, data types, or security schemes can be reused across APIs.
* Mock and test APIs.
* Import and export Open API Specification (OAS) 2.0.
* Create and delete branches for your API specification or fragment.
* View projects in edit and read-only mode to avoid conflicts in collaboration.
* See suggestions and discover RAML syntax via a “shelf” built.
* Preview your API with the new RAML console.
