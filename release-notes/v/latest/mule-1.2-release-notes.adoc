== Mule 1.2

*Oracle Advanced Queuing Support*

* Mule now has specific support for Oracle AQ, and handling for Oracle Message types.

*Secure Mail Protocols Support*

* Built in support for SMTPs, POP3s, and IMAPs secure protocols.

*Transport Improvements*

* Soap named parameter handling has been improved.
* Quartz Provider Can now schedule events rather than just trigger components. This means you can do things like schedule a call on one endpoint and dispatch the results of the call to another endpoint.
* Ftp Provider can now do receives on an FTP endpoint.
* Ejb Provider can now poll a remote EJB to trigger events.
* Rmi Provider can now poll a remote service to trigger events.
* Http Provider can now poll a URL/REST service to trigger events.

*Performance*

* Transacted Jms threads are now handled correctly to give much better throughput
* Non-transacted Jms now using an optimized message receiver, rather than the transacted Message Receiver.
* Fixed Http performance, which was greatly reduced due to some erroneous keep-alive handling. This also affects the performance of SOAP calls.

== New Sample Applications

* LoanBroker ESB - Implements the Loan Broker Example using a ESB architecture with a shared Message Bus.
* Voip Service Example +
The Voip Service example is taken from a Java.net featured article, link:https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-983402[Provisioning Services Through ESB]
* Stock Quote Example Now includes an example of invoking a .NET service using SOAP and REST.

* Tools: Config Graph*

* Generate Visio-style Configuration Graphs from Mule Xml files. Very cool!
