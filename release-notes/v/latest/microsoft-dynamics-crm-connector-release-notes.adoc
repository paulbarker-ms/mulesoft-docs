+
[NOTE]

== 2.2.0

*March 17, 2015*

The CRM Connector 2.2 release is a minor feature release:

New in this release:

* The CRM Connector now offers a bulk version of Create, Update, and Delete that performs multiple operations in one web service call. This dramatically improves performance where a large volume of records are being acted upon (approximately 5x throughput). DataSense schemas for each operation provide easy mapping of records into the list based payload.

* Leveraging the new bulk operations, the CRM Connector has also been made batch aware. This allows the batch scopes to be leveraged, with the commit step performing a bulk create, update or delete operation.

* The Execute operation has been reworked to make it significantly easier to use. A small set of commonly requested Execute messages are now supported with DataSense schemas, no longer requiring custom crafting of bean definitions in the Mule project to invoke them. Note: The revised Execute operation is not backward compatible with the model used in previous CRM Connector versions, so flows utilizing the old model must be migrated.

* *Improved connection troubleshooting*: The Test Connection functionality of the connector is now much more robust, and provides detailed and helpful error messages for the most common configuration or connectivity problems.

* *Kerberos auto-configuration*: Configuration of Kerberos authentication is now much simpler for on-premises installations, with auto-discovery of KDC and SPN reducing the need to supply these details. Most installations now typically only require providing the domain account and a password to connect with.

* *Claims authentication*: Support for claims-based authentication is now provided in the Dynamics CRM connector, allowing flexibility of authentication model choice for ADFS-enabled enterprises.

* *NTLM authentication*: It is now possible to use NTLM authentication to connect to CRM via the Anypoint Gateway Service for Windows.

* *Improved DSQL support*: DSQL has been improved to provide better translation to the native FetchXML format used by CRM, covering more operators and exposing more detailed view of the object graph to be returned in query builder. Support is provided for both in-built and custom entities.

* *More complete object model:* The object model for CRUD of CRM objects is now more complete, allowing you to get deep visibility into the structure and properties of messages in and out of CRM. This is particularly helpful for reference fields, for example where one entity has a relationship with another entity.

* *CRM 2013 support*: The Dynamics CRM connector now provides support for CRM 2011 + CRM 2013 On-Premises installs and hosted CRM Online instances in a single unified connector. Simply drop the connector into your flow, and specify the connection details for your specific instance.
