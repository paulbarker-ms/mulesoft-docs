_Premium_

Anypoint Connector for PeopleSoft provides real-time connectivity to query and update any PeopleSoft module using a common integration interface known as the Component Interface.

== 2.1.1

*January 26, 2018*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime |3.6.x and later
|Java|7
|PeopleSoft|9.2
|PeopleTools|8.53.02
|===


=== Features

None.

=== Fixed in this Release

* FIND operation - The FIND operation failed when at least one returned field was not listed as searchable. This was fixed. The connector filters those fields instead of failing.
* List values - The connector was not handling requests with list values properly, often taking just the first value of the list. This now works as expected.
* Auto-generated IDs - When using the SAVE operation to create an object with the ID set as `NEW`, the connector did not return the ID generated by PeopleSoft. It now retrieves and returns it.
* TPESVCFAIL error - Under some scenarios, the connector would throw this error on SAVE operations with multivalued list attributes. This no longer happens.

== 2.1.0

*October 13, 2016*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime |3.6.x and later
|Java|7
|PeopleSoft|9.2
|PeopleTools|8.53.02
|===


=== Features

* Domain Connection Password - The present version allows the use of the property "DomainConnectionPwd" to be set in the Global Element settings of the PeopleSoft connector. In the XML, the new attribute will be displayed as below:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
    <peoplesoft:config name="PeopleSoft"
        server="${config.server}"
        username="${config.username}"
        password="${config.password}"
        domainConnectionPwd="${config.domainConnectionPwd}"
        ...
    </peoplesoft:config>
----

Oracle recommends the use of Domain Connection passwords on all the new releases. The domain connection password adds an extra layer of security between the PeopleSoft application server domain and any connections made to it. It is recommended to use PSADMIN to update this value. All domains, PeopleSoft Internet Architecture, and three-tier workstations used for a particular database, must use the same domain connection password. The default value is PS.

=== Fixed in this Release

N-Level iteration for GET operation - When retrieving information from a CI (Component Interface), if a field of the CI response contained an array list, the connector didn't perform an 'n'-level iteration, it only retrieved the first element of the list. The new version of the connector correctly displays all levels of nested objects.



== 2.0.1

*April 8, 2016*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime |3.6.x and later
|Java|7
|PeopleSoft|9.2
|PeopleTools|8.53.02
|===

=== Fixed in this Release

Support for effective-dated components when performing a creation or an update. Key fields sent along the payload got lost in the process, resulting in the misleading error message "No rows exist for the specified keys".

== 2.0.0

*September 7, 2015*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime |3.6.x and later
|Java|7
|PeopleSoft|9.2
|PeopleTools|8.53.02
|===

=== Features

* Improvement of Test Connectivity. This includes validation for every Component Interface declared in the WhiteList.

* Support for Multi-Level DataSense. Previously, the list of available components and operations was contained within a single dropdown menu and each item was displayed in the form of `Component#Operation`. Now, that list has been split in two: one dropdown for the component names and the other for the available operations. Additionaly, the redundant operation label Invoke Operation has been renamed to Invoke Component Interface.

* *DataWeave* integration to demo examples.


== 1.1.0

*March 31, 2015*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime |3.6.x and later
|Java|7
|PeopleSoft|9.2
|PeopleTools|8.53.02
|===

=== Features

* Added native library support for Mule projects created in Anypoint Studio without Maven. It enables you to add the required PeopleSoft Java Object Adapter (psjoa.jar) library from the Global Element configuration, without having to use Maven or to install the JAR locally and add the dependency to the Project Object Model (POM).
* Included new demo examples for invoking Find, Get, and Save operations on your Component Interfaces.

== 1.0 (Public Beta)

*February 17, 2015*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime |3.5.2 and later
|Java|7
|PeopleSoft|9.2
|PeopleTools|8.53.02
|===

=== Features

Based on the Component Interface White List provided in Connection Management, PeopleSoft connector exposes the PeopleSoft components through the Invoke operation. Using DataSense, the connector automatically populates the Record fields and methods defined by the Component Interface. Record fields on the component are mapped to the keys and properties of the component interface. Both Standard and User-defined methods created in the PeopleSoft Application Designer on the component are retrieved by the connector using DataSense feature of Mule Devkit.

=== Usage Information

Because of the complex nature and the underlying limitations of PeopleSoft and its integration interfaces, you may encounter the following while using the PeopleSoft connector. 

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Issue Type|Description
.2+|Compatibility
|PeopleSoft connector works only in Java 1.7.0_x environment. You need to make sure that AnyPoint Studio, Mule Standalone, CloudHub deployment, or any associated software is using Java 1.7.0_x for the connector to work properly. 
|The connector supports integration with PeopleSoft v9.2 and PeopleTools v8.53.02 or higher.
.3+|Component Interface Configuration
|Since Component Interfaces provide an API that is identical to the business Component they provide an interface to, the input data is also bound by all of the defaults, codes and required values that would be required to use the Component in a Web browser. Values provided must match the values provided to the component, which may require looking up. (For example, drop downs may contain "US Dollars" as a value visible to the user, but the code "USA" is provided to the Component Interface.) 
|When you try to use the connector with a PeopleSoft Component Interface, you may receive errors related to the functional validity of the data. You need to work with a PeopleSoft functional specialist to resolve the reason for these errors. 
|Due to the design of Component Interfaces, the names of some operations can be misleading. For example, *Create* operations only returns a handle to a new instance (logically equivalent to clicking *New* for a given component), but does not update the data in PeopleSoft. If you want to make changes to the PeopleSoft data, you must use the *Save* operation.
.2+|Mule Application Configuration
|You must provide a Component Interface white list in your Mule flow for DataSense and the connector to work correctly.
|You must provide a psjoa.jar file, which is compiled with your PeopleSoft instance, in your Build path. Without the file, Mule applications throw a ClassNotFound exception. The psjoa.jar file is provided by your PeopleSoft administrator(s).

Important: PeopleSoft 9.2 includes several modules, such as: Human Capital Management (HCM), Financial Management (FM), Enterprise Services Automation (ESA), Supplier Relationship Management (SRM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Campus Solution (CS).
