== Management Console

The new version of the Mule ESB Management Console replaces the console formerly known as Mule HQ. While Mule HQ was built on technology from Hyperic, the new version of the console was built from the ground up, reflecting significant feedback from our customers.

Hyperic is optimized for general-purpose monitoring, while the new management console is tightly integrated with Mule ESB and optimized for Mule use cases, including deep Mule-specific diagnostics and auditing capabilities, as well as intelligent alerting for Mule SLAs. The new management console both complements and integrates with open source and commercial monitoring tools, including Hyperic.

To find out more about the Mule Management Console release version 2.2.5, please see the link:/release-notes/legacy-mule-release-notes[Release Notes] and the Mule Management Console link:/mule-management-console/v/3.7[Home] page.

== Mule ESB

Mule ESB 2.2.5 now supports hot deployment of web applications to JBoss 4.x, Tomcat 5.5.x and 6.0.x, and Tcat Server 6. It also includes support for IBM JDK 1.5 and 1.6 certification, and it introduces support for a recipient list exception-based router. Last, CXF has been upgraded to version 2.1.9.

== Known Issues

This section describes the known issues in this release and, when possible, how to work around each issue.

* XsltTransformer does not work in Hot Deployment. The XsltTransformer cannot load an xsl file when Mule is deployed in an EAR outside the WAR.
* Deploying mule-enterprise-jca-jboss-2.2.5 into JBoss 4.2.3.GA shows Incomplete Deployment error. Although this error displays, you can ignore it since Mule is up and running.
* Tcat Server Console and MMC cannot be hosted on the same tomcat instance. This will be fixed for the GA release.

== Fixed Issues

Following is a complete list issues fixed specifically for Mule Enterprise Version 2.2.5
