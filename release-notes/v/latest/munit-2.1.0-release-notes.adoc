== Features and Functionality

=== MUnit Runtime

MUnit 2.1.0 is the first iteration after our major release of MUnit 2. +
We have manage to fix a small number of issues that were affecting the product mainly inter op of it and also added several key features that were intentionally left out of MUnit 2.0.0.

The first new feature we added is Domain Support. You can now test your applications that are dependent of a Mule Domain without a second thought, just add your application’s domain dependency to the application’s pom.xml file and you’re ready to go.

We’ve also leveraged a new feature of Mule Runtime, lazy connections. With this new capability no connections to external systems will be created until they are actually required.
Whit the new assert processor created in MUnit 2 we now have the capability to add value without breaking our DSL. In this release we have added a new set of assertion matchers that will help the user to run assertions over:

* Collections, Iterables, and Arrays.
* Numbers.
* Strings.




=== Anypoint Studio Plugin

With this release of the MUnit Studio Plugin  we are providing Datasense support. +
You also have the ability to create a launch configuration based on the munit-maven-plugin configuration described in the pom.xml file which allows you to configure once and reuse it when running from Anypoint Studio or Maven without differences.

* Improve metadata handling in Anypoint Studio.
