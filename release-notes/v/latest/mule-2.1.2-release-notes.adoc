= Mule 2.1.2 Release Notes
:keywords: release notes, esb


The 2.1.2 maintenance release includes many bug fixes and improvements, including several improvements to the Maven archetypes:

* There are now separate archetypes for examples and modules, making it easier to create new Mule examples and modules and to add them to an existing project.
* The project archetype has been cleaned up and enhanced to be easier to use.
* A readme is now added to the generated content of the project and transport archetypes. These readmes describe what was generated and provide some useful links for the developer to get more information.
* For all four types of archetypes, you can now specify which modules and transports you want to include and have the archetype generate the correct POM entries for you.
* New Mule 2 classes are generated on top of an existing Mule project.

Additionally, release 2.1.2 includes validation and instructions for configuring CXF to run on the Jetty transport.
