== 4.0.1

*December 14, 2016*

Release notes for version 4.0.1 of the Oracle EBS Connector. These release notes accompany the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/oracle-ebs-connector-user-guide[Oracle E-Business Suite Connector] guide.

=== Compatibility

The Oracle EBS Connector is compatible with:

|===
|Application/Service|Version

|Mule Runtime|3.7 and later
|Anypoint Studio|5.2.1 and later
|Oracle EBS|12.1.x
|Java|7
|===

=== Fixed in this Release

* XML External Entities (XXE) vulnerability - By default, XML parsers are weakly configured thus enabling XML External Entity attack (for example, disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery) when the application parses XML input. To prevent XXE, DTDs (External Entities) have been completely disabled in all the XML parsers used by the connector.

== 4.0.0

=== Migrating from Older Versions of the Connector

If you’re currently using the 3.0.0 version of this connector, migrating to the current version implies the steps listed below depending on the use case:

If you are using the connector to consume web services:

* Edit your global configuration element using the XML editor.
* Remove the following parameters: dbUser, dbPassword, dbHost, dbPort and dbSid.
* You can also remove the `aqapi.jar` and `ojdbc6.jar` files from the classpath.

If you are using the connector to subscribe to Business Events or XML Gateway Outbound messages:

* Create a new "Oracle EBS: JMS Configuration" element.
* Add the database connection parameters: host, port, username, password and SID.
* Add the required dependencies (`aqapi.jar` and `ojdbc6.jar`). You can find them in your EBS instance, under the following paths:
** `$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/jlib/aqapi.jar`
** `$ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib/ojdbc6.jar`
* Reference this new configuration in all references to the EBS Connector as a message source in your Mule app.
* If you are not using the connector to consume web services, you can remove the old configuration as it is no longer needed.

=== New Features

*Durable subscriptions*: when subscribing to Business Events, a durable subscription can be registered. This way, all messages sent to the topic while the client is offline will be retrieved as soon as it regains connectivity.

=== Fixed in this Release

- *Business Events and XML Gateway Outbound*: Fixed bug in which the Mule app would stop responding for a period of time when receiving a large number of messages.
- *User Permission*: The connector used to require the ALL_USER permission in order for PL/SQL web services to be called in EBS, but this release supports a specific user permission.

== 3.0.0

*January 26, 2016*

Release notes for version 3.0.0 of the Oracle EBS Connector. These release notes accompany the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/oracle-ebs-connector-user-guide[Oracle E-Business Suite Connector] guide.

=== New Features

- *TrustStore support*: the connector can now be configured with a custom Trust Store, which would prevent calls to web services from failing when using self-signed certificates.

=== Fixed in this Release

- *Business Events*: parsing messages from the Business Events topic is now done dynamically, meaning that all attributes, regardless of whether they are custom or not, will be present in the connector's output.


== 2.0.1

*October 2, 2015*

Release Notes for version 2.0.1 of the Oracle EBS Connector. These release notes accompany the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/oracle-ebs-connector-user-guide[Oracle E-Business Suite Connector] guide.

This is a minor release, including only bug fixes since the release of 2.0.0.

=== Fixed in this Release

- *Test Connection* button in Global Element Properties screen had not been working. After entering host details and credentials when creating the configuration for Oracle EBS, clicking the *Test Connection* button produced an error. It has been fixed to check whether the connection to Oracle EBS can be established or not.

=== Known Issues

None.
