== Important Notes and Known Issues in this Release

=== Mule Management Console

[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Adding a cluster to a group |If you place a cluster in a server group, you may experience issues with deployments which target the group instead of the cluster directly.  +
*Workaround:* Use the cluster as one of the direct targets of your deployments. If you experience issues, check the apps directory in your Mule server(s) to confirm functionality.
|Adding a server to a group |If you add a server to a group via the server details panel (using the settings tab and editing the server info), deployments targeting the group are not transferred to the newly added server. +
*Workaround:* Use the Add to Group button in the server list grid. 
|Error Messages |Some error messages in the MMC main window may contain a "See More" link which, when clicked, displays a new window containing only the text `null`. +
*Workaround:* There is no applicable workaround, but you can safely ignore this issue.

== Third Party Connectors and other modules

At this time, not all of the third party modules you may have been using with previous versions of Mule ESB have been upgraded to work with Mule ESB 3.4.1. mailto:sales@mulesoft.com[Contact MuleSoft] if you have a question about a specific module.

== Migrating from Mule ESB 3.4.0 to 3.4.1

The improvements and fixes that Mule ESB 3.4.1 introduces require no specific migration activities for Mule ESB or Mule Management Console. For more details on how to migrate from previous versions of Mule ESB, access the migration guide embedded within the release notes for previous versions of Mule, or the link:/release-notes/legacy-mule-migration-notes[library of legacy Migration Guides].

View the instructions for migrating MMC from version 3.3.1 to 3.4.1

== Migrating from MMC v.3.3.1 to v3.4.1

Migrating from 3.3.1 version of MMC to 3.4.1 encompasses a list of steps. In versions 3.3.x and below, the agent MMC uses to interact with the Mule instances is a Mule application, whereas in 3.4.X it is a Mule plugin. If you are managing Mule instances with versions 3.3.1 or below, and you are not willing to upgrade those instances, you will need to upgrade the agent application to the latest version as it is the only one compatible with later versions of MMC.

In Mule:

. Remove mmc-agent-mule3-app-3.3.1 folder and -anchor file from your Mule's apps directory.
. Back up .mule/mmc-agent-mule3-app-3.3.1/trustore.jks and .mule/mmc-agent-mule3-app-3.3.1/.instanceId files.
. Remove .mule/mmc-agent-mule3-app-3.3.1 folder.
. Download and copy the mmc-agent-mule3-app-3.3.3.zip file into the apps folder of your mule.
. Create a mmc-agent-mule3-app-3.3.3 folder under .mule directory and copy the previously backed up trustore.jks file.
. Start Mule.

For MMC:

. Back up the mmc-console-3.3.1/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF folder from your exploded WAR file (to save configuration that you may need to replicate in the new MMC version).
. Back up /apps/mmc/webapps/mmc/WEB-INF/classes/mmc-ldap.properties if exists.
. Remove mmc-console-3.3.1 from your application server. For example, in tomcat, remove the war and exploded folder from the webapps directory.
. Back up (just in case) the mmc-data folder (in tomcat, it's at straight below the root folder). Do NOT remove this directory.
. Copy the new 3.4.1 WAR and start the app server (if it was not started yet).

At this point you should see all your information in the new MMC if you are using all the MMC defaults. Refer to the next sections if you have customized any aspect (externalized persistence, authentication through ldap, etc)

=== Migrating Persistence Configuration

If you have externalized the persistence of status/environment data or business events (tracking data), you will need to replicate the configuration in the new MMC version.

==== Migrating Status/Environment Configuration

Copy the configuration from the previously backed up files. Look at link:/mule-management-console/v/3.3/persisting-environment-data[this guide] to determine the list of changes you need to copy over. Do not override the files with the old ones. Only jackrabbit-repo.xml can be safely overwritten.

You need to modify the following files to include the connection parameters:

`mmc.properties` +
`applicationContext.xml` +
`jackrabbit-repo.xml` +
`scheduler.properties`

You also need to copy the corresponding driver into the lib folder of the application. Follow the instructions in the documentation page for the appropriate db engine.

You need to restart the application for these changes to take effect.

==== Migrating Business Events (Tracking) configuration

You need to copy the configuration from the previously backed up files. Look at link:/mule-management-console/v/3.3/persisting-transaction-data[this guide] to determine the list of changes you need to copy over. Do not override the files with the old ones. Only jackrabbit-repo.xml can be safely overwritten.

You need to modify the following files to include the connection parameters:

`persistence.xml` +
`applicationContext-tracking.xml`

You also need to copy the corresponding driver into the lib folder of the application. Follow the instructions in the documentation page for the appropriate db engine.

You need to restart the application for these changes to take effect

=== Migrating LDAP configuration

. Copy the file /apps/mmc/webapps/mmc/WEB-INF/classes/mmc-ldap.properties you have previously backed up to the same location of the expanded application. +
If such file does not exist, copy the ldap.xml file under the backed up META-INF directory to the same location in the newly exploded war.
. Open Web.xml file and locate this section:

+
----
<param-name>spring.profiles.active</param-name><param-value>tracking-h2</param-value>
----

+
modify the second line to:

+
----
<param-value>tracking-h2,ldap</param-value>
----

. Restart the application.
