= Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition 1.5.0 Release Notes
*October 14, 2016*

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition takes all the power of the platform MuleSoft developed for the Cloud and enables companies to run the platform inside their data centers.  In this release we are releasing solutions for APIs, Runtime Management and Exchange.



== Features

=== API Manager

link:/api-manager[API Manager] is a multi-tenant end-to-end platform for enterprise API design, implementation, management, and engagement.

=== Anypoint Runtime Manager

link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager] enables users to enhance their unified monitoring experience by easily integrating their on-premises Mule servers and API Gateways with third partiesâ€™ monitoring tools, such as Splunk & ELK, for monitoring, analytics and governance.


The Private Cloud Edition of Runtime Manager is also enabled to deploy applications to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (Beta). See link:/anypoint-platform-pcf/v/1.5/pcf-workflow[Configuring Anypoint Platform for PCF].


=== Anypoint Exchange

link:/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange] enables users to publish and access Mule-related content within their own organization increasing visibility and reuse across organizations.
