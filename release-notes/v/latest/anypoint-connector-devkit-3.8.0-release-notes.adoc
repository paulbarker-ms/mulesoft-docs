== New Features

* link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/certified-connector-license-management[License management for MuleSoft Certified Connectors].
** Developers can allow customers to try their connector in design time, yet ensure their connector only works with a valid license in deployment.
* link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/soap-connect-session-management[SOAP Session Management] for SOAP Connect enabling developers to inject session tokens in HTTP cookies/headers, or SOAP headers.
** Further DevKit SOAP Connect functionality includes link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/soap-connect-session-management#enriching-soap-body-with-session-token[SOAP message body enrichment] with the session token.
** link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/creating-a-soap-connector#operation-filtering[Operation Filtering] to hide operations specified in the WSDL such as login/logout, which is necessary in order to exclude operations from the operations dropdown exposed to the application developer.
* link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/adding-datasense#caching-metadata[Caching metadata] improves fetching of metadata during application design, and decreases the wait time for connector users.
* Connector APIDoc documentation is provided intelligently at design time, serving as a contextual help feature
* Improved APIDoc documentation generator creates documentation for multiple connection configurations automatically and covers filters and transformers too. In addition, it does *not require or support* code snippets referencing the `xml.sample` file such as `<@sample.xml ... >`.  See link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/connector-reference-documentation[Creating Connector Reference Documentation].
** In migrating a connector project to DevKit 3.8, all the `@sample` tags referencing the sample files must be removed
* A simple Maven command is available for the DevKit user to run connector functional tests (CTF) on CloudHub. Read through the  link:http://mulesoft.github.io/connector-certification-docs/advanced/index.html#_test_execution[Test Execution section] of the connector certification information for details.
* Functional test framework supports @Source tests.
* JDK 8 support for DevKit and connector project creation. To use JDK 8, please add the following property in your pom.xml file.
