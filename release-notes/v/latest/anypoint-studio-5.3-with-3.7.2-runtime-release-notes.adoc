== Hardware and Software System Requirements

* For most use cases, Anypoint Studio with the 3.7.x Runtime does not change hardware or software requirements.

* MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM.

* This version of Anypoint Studio requires Java 7.
*Note*: If you are installing Anypoint Studio on a Mac computer with OS X that has no Java installed, the OS may require that you first download and install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html[JDK 1.6]. Install JDK 1.6 first and then install JDK 1.7.

== Migration Guide

From the previous versions of Studio (5.1.1, 5.2.0, 5.2.1) there is no special migration needed, but when coming from older versions, it's recommended that you create a new workspace to host projects built with this new version. When opening a previous Workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project. Note that performing this conversion might imply loosing previously defined run configurations.

[NOTE]
Studio as an Eclipse plugin only works with Eclipse 4.3 or 4.4 due to an SWT dependency.

[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.

Then specify the location of your old version of Anypoint Studio in your local drive.
====

== Known Issues

* Error highlighting in the XML view sometimes does not properly refresh until you go to the Message Flow view and back to the XML view. (STUDIO-7027)
* When API Gateway runtime version 2.0.0 and newer is not installed in Studio, you cannot choose between 1.3.2 Gateway or 3.7.2 Mule runtimes. (STUDIO-7064)
