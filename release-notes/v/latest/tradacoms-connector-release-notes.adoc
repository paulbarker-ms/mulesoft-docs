*April 27, 2017*

=== Compatibility

|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime |3.7.0 and later
|Java | 7
|===

=== Features

None.

=== Fixed in this Release

* *Unable to load metadata schemas* - In the previous version, the metadata failed to get populated and displayed an error message similar to _"Could not load schema /tradacoms/ORDERS.esl"_. This issue was caused by a dependency conflict between the EDI Parser version shipped with the connector (that contains a bugfix for TRADACOMS) and the one present in Mule Runtime 3.8.0 to 3.8.3 (that doesn't include the fix). The present version solves the issue for all the runtimes. In addition, version 1.0.1 of the connector will still work if used with any of the 3.7.x runtimes or with the latest 3.8.4.
