== New Features

=== Graphical Mapping Meets DataWeave

Studio now includes graphical mapping capabilities for link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/dataweave[DataWeave], allowing you to easily perform drag and drop mappings, with all the power of the DataWeave runtime. As you construct the mapping, the DataWeave code and your output preview are dynamically built, allowing you to see the results as you progress.

=== DataMapper to DataWeave Migration Assistant

For link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference[DataMapper] users, a migration tool is now included in Studio, which will assist users in converting their maps to link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/dataweave-reference-documentation[DataWeave Scripts]. Users can right click on DataMapper, select Migrate to DataWeave, and follow the instructions.

=== Other Improvements

There are several other improvements in this release as well:

* The Mule project menus have been reorganized to provide improved usability.
* Improved performance in the rendering of editors and flows.
* link:/munit/v/1.3/index[MUnit] is now included out of the box in Studio, making it easier to get started testing your Mule applications.
* Many bug fixes


== Hardware and Software System Requirements

* For most use cases, Anypoint Studio with the 3.7.x Runtime does not change hardware or software requirements.

* MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM.

* This version of Anypoint Studio requires Java 7.

*Note*: If you are installing Anypoint Studio on a Mac computer with OS X that has no Java installed, the OS may require that you first download and install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html[JDK 1.6]. Install JDK 1.6 first and then install JDK 1.7.

== Migration Guide

* From the previous version of Studio 5.1.0, 5.1.1, 5.2.0, 5.2.1, to 5.3.0 there is no special migration needed, but when opening a previous Workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project.

[NOTE]
Studio as an Eclipse plugin only works with Eclipse 4.3 or 4.4 due to an SWT dependency.

[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.

Then specify the location of your old version of Anypoint Studio in your local drive.
