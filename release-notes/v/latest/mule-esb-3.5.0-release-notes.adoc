== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, 3.5.0 Runtime does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by earlier runtimes. MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4 GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM.

== Deprecated in this Release

Nothing was deprecated in the 3.5.0 Runtime.

== Migration Guide

For a full and detailed list of considerations when migrating from the previous version to this one, see the  MIGRATION.txt file, located in the root folder of Mule.
