= Mule ESB 3.4.0 Release Notes 
:keywords: release notes, esb

*April 16, 2013*

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the release of **Mule ESB 3.4.0** which introduces new functionality and improvements to our industry-leading ESB software.

These release notes apply to both the Community and the Enterprise runtimes of Mule ESB 3.4.0. Where appropriate, we have applied an *_Enterprise_* marker to identify features or functionality that are available only in the Enterprise runtime.

For this release, we have focused our efforts on features and tools that improve developer productivity and make SaaS integration even easier.  Our new version of Studio now functions as a single download, enabling developers to easily switch between Community and Enterprise runtimes.  We also continue to harden our product, making it more stable and easier to use as we apply bug fixes and improvements.

== New Features and Functionality

* *Visual Flow Debugger*: Enables users to insert breakpoints in flows, step through breakpoints in the link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/studio-visual-debugger[visual debugger], and examine message content as it moves through the flow.  Remote debugging is also supported.
* *Anypoint DataMapper Enhancements*: *_Enterprise_* Includes the ability to use information from other flows directly in mapping, the ability to modify your input/output without losing mappings, and the support for the Mule Expression Language directly within the DataMapper transformation logic. Refer to the link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference[Anypoint DataMapper documentation] for more detail.
* *Studio as an Eclipse Distribution*: Studio is available as a link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/studio-in-eclipse[Eclipse plugin package]. User can now leverage Studio with Eclipse 3.8-based IDEs, including Spring Tool Suite (STS).  We support the Java, Java EE, and STS 3.1.0 distributions that use Eclipse 3.8. 
* *Studio Documentation Generation*: Studio provides the ability to link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/importing-and-exporting-in-studio[generate HTML-based documentation] for a project. These materials contain the diagram and XML for flows and the description of flows and their components as entered by developers within the application.
* **Metadata-Based Development**: *_Enterprise_* This feature, called link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7/adding-datasense[DataSense], automatically discovers the operation data types for several Anypoint Connectors so as to prescribe mapping within a DataMapper. You no longer have to explore the documentation of your connectors and the description of their underlying APIs in order to be able understand their data types – DataSense automatically discovers and displays them in Studio.
* *Maven support*: Enhancements to make it easier for users to link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/mule-and-maven[create and run Maven] projects directly in Studio. Further, Studio automatically maintains all dependencies. Users can link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/converting-maven-into-studio[import] Maven projects into Studio, or link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/converting-studio-into-maven[export] them as needed. 
* *Anypoint Service Registry support*: *_Enterprise_* Via an Anypoint Service Registry endpoint, Mule supports dynamic routing of messages according the rules defined within the Service Registry.
* *Transactional improvement*: *_Enterprise_* Studio supports finer-grained control over the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/transaction-management[demarcation of transactions] within flows.
* *SAP Connector improvements*: *_Enterprise_* Studio supports multiple logins for an endpoint, new XML representation for Functions (BAPI), and the ability to create JCoFUnction XML schema. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/mulesoft-enterprise-java-connector-for-sap-reference[SAP Connector documentation] for details.
* *Dynamic Changes to HA Clusters*: *_Enterprise_* Management Console supports the ability to link:/mule-management-console/v/3.7/dynamically-adding-or-removing-nodes-in-a-cluster[dynamically add or remove nodes] in a high availability cluster without disbanding it.
* *Password Encryption in Management Console*: *_Enterprise_* Management Console supports the ability to encrypt the following types of passwords: link:/mule-management-console/v/3.4/encrypting-mmc-user-passwords[user passwords] stored in the Console's default database, the link:/mule-management-console/v/3.4/encrypting-the-mmc-ldap-password[LDAP password] used by the Console in an link:/mule-management-console/v/3.4/setting-up-and-managing-users-via-ldap[LDAP authentication] configuration, and the link:/mule-management-console/v/3.4/encrypting-the-mmc-tracking-database-password[user credentials] for the Business Events database.

== Noteworthy Improvements

* *Eclipse upgrade*: Studio uses version Eclipse 3.8.

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, Mule ESB 3.4.0 does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by Mule ESB 3.3.X. link:https://www.mulesoft.com/support-and-services/mule-esb-support-license-subscription[Contact MuleSoft Support] with any questions you may have about system requirements.

== Important Notes and Known Issues in this Release

This list covers some of the known issues with Mule ESB 3.4.0. Please read this list before reporting any issues you may have spotted.

=== Mule ESB

[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Object Store a|
* Persistent object store in Mule uses the key as the filename of the object store. This activity may result in a generated filename that is invalid in Windows operating system. Workaround: use a key name (such as a hash of the key) that will result in the generation of a key with a valid filename.
* The Anypoint Service Registry agent that syncs with Mule ESB standalone perpetuates the object store filename issue in Windows. If you run standalone in Windows, download a patch for ESB 3.4.0 from the link:http://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[Customer Portal].

|MULE-6779 |Unable to load wrapper's native library Workaround: Server should work regardless of issue.
|MULE-6769 |MuleContext.dispose should call stop on started connectors and then dispose
|MULE-6765 |Chaining more than one HTTP outbound endpoint will use the HTTP method of the first one Workaround: Use a subflow for the followings endpoints.
|MULE-6721 |Restarting Mule app makes loss JMS messages due to redelivery failure Workaround: Increase max redelivery.
|EE-3200 |Exception on logs when transferring big file in clustering
|EE-3184 |Patches are not being loaded if copied in lib/patches dir. Only if they are copied in lib/user Workaround: Put patches on lib/user dir.
|EE-3183 |Starting Mule EE shows quartz start info in console
|EE-3182 |Starting Mule shows resource and provider class search details in console
|EE-3181 |Starting Mule EE shows Clustering disabled warning on console
|EE-3180 |Starting mule shows ASR missing token error on logs
|EE-3141 |When using a Throttling policy with throttling statics enabled, limit headers are swapped.
|EE-3108 |Upper case "?WSDL" not supported Workaround: Change to lowercase.
|EE-3097 |Quartz endpoint starts executing before the application has finished deploying
|EE-3076 |Setting a throttling policy with zero or negative values should throw an exception
|EE-3048 |Setting 0message/seg on a throttling policy process messages anyway
|===

=== Mule Studio

[cols="2*"]
|===
|Maven Support a|
* At present, you cannot add parameters to the `run mvn` execution. 
* When you launch it, Studio executes a job to populate the M2 repository. If this job is not finished running, Maven support function may not work as expected. Workaround: wait until Studio finishes executing the job before working on a Maven project.
* If, while running in the background, the studio:studio goal fails, Studio does not display a notification. If running in the foreground (importing or exporting a project, for example), a studio:studio failure results in a notification.

|DataSense a|
* If used in conjunction with Properties Placeholders, DataSense connectivity testing does not function.

|Studio Visual Debugger a|
* Studio allows you to modify the inbound properties of events within the debugger,  but this feature is not yet functional. 
* Studio Debugger and Java Debugger key shortcuts collide. When debugging a mule flow` ctrl+shift+i` opens a Mule evaluation window that allows you to test a Mule expression. However, when debugging a Java transformer, the same shortcut should open the Java evaluation window, but at present, opens the Mule evaluation window.

|Two-Way Editing |If XML config contains an element with an _unknown_ attribute, Studio's Message Flow canvas (i.e. the graphical interface) deletes the attribute. In other words, shifting from Studio's Visual Editor to Studio XML Editor removes the unknown attribute.  Workaround: do not shift between the XML and Visual editor.
|DataMapper |In a DataMapper which uses a JSON file in its mappings, if one of the mappings fails, all subsequent mappings fail until you terminate, then restart your application.
|eGit Plug in for Studio |Mule Studio 3.4.0 does not support the latest version of the eGit plugin (2.3.1.201302201838-r). A known issue, we will add support for the eGit plugin in a subsequent maintenance release of Studio 3.4.0. link:http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/FAQ#Where_can_I_find_older_releases_of_EGit.3F[Previous versions of the eGit plug in] are supported.
|Chaining HTTP Outbound Endpoints |If you configure more than one HTTP outbound endpoint in your flow, Mule applies the HTTP method of the first endpoint to all subsequent endpoints. For example, if the first endpoint specifies `method="GET"`, the second `method="POST"`, the third `method="GET"`, all three endpoints use HTTP method GET.  Workaround: set the HTTP method of the first outbound endpoint to `method="POST"`, then any subsequent endpoints use the HTTP method as specified.
|Studio on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS |Due to an issue with the graphical interface user toolkit (GTK), Studio freezes during launch on Ubuntu OS 12.04 LTS. Other Linux distributions pose no challenges to using Studio.
|Object Builder in Studio |Studio with 3.4.0 runtime does not support arbitrary POJO construction.
|Online Help Links to Web Doc |Eclipse dynamic help for Studio includes links to primary documentation on the Web that should open in an external browser. On platforms other than Windows, Eclipse does not reliably support opening external browsers from links in help files. On Windows, these links will open in Internet Explorer.
|===

=== Mule Management Console

[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Adding a cluster to a group |If you place a cluster in a server group, you may experience issues with deployments which target the group instead of the cluster directly. +
Workaround: Use the cluster as one of the direct targets of your deployments. If you experience issues, check the apps directory in your Mule server(s) to confirm functionality.
|Adding a server to a group |If you add a server to a group via the server details panel (using the settings tab and editing the server info), deployments targeting the group are not transferred to the newly added server. +
Workaround: Use the Add to Group button in the server list grid. 
|Error Messages |Some error messages in the MMC main window may contain a "See More" link which, when clicked, displays a new window containing only the text `null`. +
Workaround: There is no applicable workaround, but you can safely ignore this issue.

== Third Party Connectors and other modules

At this time, not all of the third party modules you may have been using with previous versions of Mule ESB have been upgraded to work with Mule ESB 3.4.0. https://support.mulesoft.com[Contact MuleSoft] if you have a question about a specific module.

== Migrating from Mule ESB 3.3.X to 3.4.0

The following sub-sections offer details on the changed and improved behaviors that Mule ESB 3.4.0 introduces. For more details on how to migrate from previous versions of Mule ESB, access the Migration Guides embedded in previous link:/release-notes[Release Notes] or the link:/release-notes/legacy-mule-migration-notes[archive of Migration Guides].

=== Custom HTTP Transport Message Receivers

To support the new throttling functionality in Mule, the behavior of HTTP transport message receivers changed. While an improved to out-of-the-box HTTP receivers, the change may introduce issues with any custom HTTP transport message receivers you may have configured. 

To adjust existing custom receivers and migrate to Mule 3.4.0:

[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|  |*Custom HTTP Receiver inherits from:* |*Adjust to extend from:*
|*HTTP* |org.mule.transport.http.HttpMessageReceiver |org.mule.transport.http.OldHttpMessageReceiver
|*HTTPS* |org.mule.transport.http.HttpsMessageReceiver |org.mule.transport.http.OldHttpsMessageReceiver
|===

However, if you prefer to use the previous implementation of HTTP transport message receivers in your custom receivers, you can revert to the previous behavior.

[cols="2*"]
|===
|*Per server* |Add attached preferred-http.properties and preferred-https.properties file in $MULE_HOME/conf/META-INF/services/org/mule/transport dir of the mule server
|*Per connector* a|
Configure the connector to use the old implementation as per the following code:

*HTTP*
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<http:connector name="connector">
    <service-overrides messageReceiver="org.mule.transport.http.OldHttpMesssageReceiver"/>
</http:connector>
----
*HTTPS*
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<https:connector name="connector">
    <service-overrides messageReceiver="org.mule.transport.http.OldHttpsMessageReceiver"/>
</https:connector>
----
|===

=== File, FTP, and SMTP Outbound Properties

For the above-listed endpoints, some outbound properties are no longer available. (The inbound properties remain the same.) If you have configured your endpoints with any of the endpoints in the table below, change the property to a inbound. 

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Endpoint |Outbound Properties Not Available
|File a|
* directory
* fileSize
* originalFilename

|FTP a|
* fileSize
* originalFilename
* timestamp

|SMTP a|
* attachment headers
* bccAddresses
* ccAddresses
* contentType
* customHeaders
* fromAddress, recipients
* recipientType
* replyToAddresses
* sentDate
* subject
* toAddresses

=== Jackson Upgrade

Mule includes native support for JSON via the Jackson library. To take advantage of several bug fixes, Mule 3.4.0 uses the  latest updated version: Jackson 1.9.11.

=== JCA Removal

In Mule 3.4.0, we have removed the support modules used for the following distributions:

* mule-module-jca-core
* mule-module-jca-generic 
* mule-module-jca-jboss

=== localhost Behavior

Mule ESB 3.4.0 adjusts the behavior of the TCP server socket binding to provide better security by default.   This change affects the following transports: TCP, SSL, HTTP, HTTPS and Jetty.

Previously, localhost binding opened your local system to all public interfaces. This presented a potential security risk as it opened an unsecure channel to your private local system.  By default, TCP server socket bindings in Mule applications now bind to the defined localhost on your computer, usually the loopback, 127.0.0.1.  This change means that when you bind to localhost, you alone will be able to access the Mule application.  To make the application available to all public interfaces beyond your own local system, bind to 0.0.0.0.

This added security feature will change the behavior of any localhost bindings currently in place in your existing Mule applications– anything bound to localhost restricts access to you alone on your local system.  

However, if you prefer to keep localhost open to all public interfaces (i.e. revert to previous behavior for localhost), you can adjust an environment variable to ensure open access of localhost bindings. Set the following variable on your local environment:  `mule.tcp.bindlocalhosttoalllocalinterfaces = true`

We strongly recommend, however, that rather than use the environment variable to enable open access by all public interfaces, you adjust the binding on any existing Mule application to 0.0.0.0 as described above.  Taking this step ensures that the binding behavior is consistent across applications.

* localhost = 127.0.0.1 = local access only
* 0.0.0.0 = access by all public interfaces

[NOTE]
====
This change may cause confusion if the name of your _computer_ is localhost. In practice, this issue usually only surfaces with Mac computers.

Check the name of your computer (System Preferences > Sharing) and change it to something other than localhost to prevent issues with interfaces.
====

=== Maven and Anypoint Connectors

When working with a Maven project in Studio, Mule seamlessly and automatically updates all Anypoint connector dependencies.  This dependency support ensures that any connectors you use in your flows always have the correct dependencies updated for Maven.  We recommend updating any connectors you may use in your Mule applications to the latest versions to ensure that your connectors, and their dependencies, are all up-to-date.

However, if you prefer to continue using older versions of connectors in your Maven project in Studio, you can link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/maven-support-in-anypoint-studio[disable Maven support] in Studio, which also disables the automatic updates of connector dependencies. * https://support.mulesoft.com[Contact MuleSoft] for more details about how to disable Maven to maintain the use of older connectors.

=== Model Deprecation

The use of Models is formally deprecated along with services in Mule 3.4.0 and will be removed in Mule 4.0.  This includes the SedaModel configured with the `<model>` XML element and any custom implementations.  Further, support for flows configured inside a model is now deprecated.  You can configure a flows outside a `<model>` elements without incurring any differences in behavior.  

=== Mule Expression Language and NullPayload

To improve usability, Mule Expression Language (MEL) no longer exposes `org.mule.transport.NullPayload`.  

In Mule 3.4.0, if the message payload is an instance of `NullPayload`, the expression `#[message.payload]` returns `null (not NullPayload)`.  This slight adjustment allows easier value testing via expressions. If you are currently testing payload value in your MEL expressions using `NullPayload`, be sure to update your expressions to use `null`. 

[%header,cols="2*",grid=all]
|===
|Previously
|Currently

|#[message.payload is org.mule.transport.NullPayload]
.3+^.^|#[message.payload == null]

|#[message.payload is org.mule.transport.NullPayload]

|#[message.payload instanceof org.mule.transport.NullPayload]|
|===

[NOTE]
Groovy expressions remain unaffected by this change to Mule Expression Language.

=== Mule Expression Language MVEL Upgrade 

To leverage the many bug fixes available in the latest version of MVEL, we have upgraded the expression engine that Mule Expression Language leverages to MVEL 2.1.3. 

=== SAP Connector Changes

Because transaction support in the SAP Connector version 1.x is very limited (only transactions with one function call are allowed), we have made improvements to SAP Connector 2.1.0 to support more complex transactions. Thus, the attribute `bapiTransaction` is no longer present at the transaction level; it has moved to the outbound endpoint.

For detail about the use and configuration parameters of the bapiTransaction attribute, refer to link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/outbound-endpoint-transactions[Outbound Endpoint Transactions]. 

=== Services Deprecation

Services, both SedaSrvices configured via the `<service>` XML element and custom services configured via the `<custom-service>` XML are formally deprecated in Mule 3.4.0 and will be removed in Mule 4.0.  All functionality provided by services can be accomplished, with significant advantages, using link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/mule-application-architecture[flows].  For further information about migrating from Services to Flows see the explanatory http://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/mule-dev/migrating-to-mule-3-service-or-flow/[blog post].


=== Spring Upgrade

To leverage the newest features in Spring features, Mule has adopted Spring 3.2.1. Review http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/new-in-3.2.html[new features of Spring 3.2.1] and examine the related http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/migration-3.2.html[Spring Migration Guide].

=== UDP Connector

To ensure consistency amongst transports, the UDP connector's `packet.address` and `packet.port` properties now have an inbound scope.

=== Undeployment of Applications

As an improvement, Mule now invokes the undeployment of an application when you remove its anchor file. Previously, removing an anchor file resulted in a failure to invoke undeployment– an app without an anchor file could run indefinitely. This change ensures consistent behavior upon removal of an anchor file.  

=== User Object Store 

Utilized primarily by Mule Extensions and Anypoint Connectors, User Object Store has been changed to become persistent by default. (By default, User Object Store used to be transient.) 

However, if you prefer that User Object Store be transient, you can disable persistence by adjusting the following system property: `mule.objectstore.user.transient="true"`
