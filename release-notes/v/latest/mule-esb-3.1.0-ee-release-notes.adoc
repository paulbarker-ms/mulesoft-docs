== Mule 3.1 Improvements

The biggest enhancements in Mule 3.1 are the new features for Mule Cloud-Connect. It is now very simple to, for instance:

* Invoke a cloud service
* Use the data it returns to invoke other services
* Combine the data returned by all of these services
* Use the result to invoke yet another service (or write it to a database, or persist it as XML, or format it as a web page, or...There's really no limit but your imagination.)

=== Migration from Previous Versions

For instructions on migrating from a previous version, consult the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/release-and-migration-notes[Mule Migration page].

=== Invocation Improvements

The three main innovations are:

* *invoke*, which makes calling a cloud service a snap.
* *poll*, which makes it easy to poll a service for incoming data.
* *enricher*, which lets you combine data from many different calls into one rich message.

=== Improvements to Logging

In addition, Mule configurations now support a simple yet powerful logging facility, which provides access to log4J levels and categories together with the full range of Mule expressions. For instance,

* CXF 2.3.0 support includes WS-Addressing, WS-Reliable Messaging, and WS-Secure Conversation

== Major Improvements

* MULE-4689 - The crytpix libs used by the PGP module replace with bouncycastle
* MULE-4774 - EndpointMessageNotification now provided for response messages of synchronous transports
* MULE-5110 - Defining attribute "processEngine-ref" of connector "jbpm-connector" as IDREF in mule-bpm.xsd is now less restrictive
* MULE-5114 - JBPM 4.4 now supported
* MULE-5152 - MULE_HOME no longer needs to be set before starting Mule
* MULE-5204 - Hibernate version 3.6.0 now supported
* MULE-5224 - Generates warnings for deprecated schema elements
* MULE-5228 - Variable expression evaluator/enricher for temporary storage during flow
* MULE-5248 - JCA packaging from CE removed

* *Hardening*

* *Professional QA*

== Mule Management Console Highlights

* *Application provisioning (Deployment support)*

* *Integrated Application Repository*

* *Dashboards*

* *Service Metrics (Throughput, Response Time, Errors)*

* *Additional SLA Alerts (JMX metrics, etc)*

* *Versioning backward compatibility agent*

* *Permissions (Role base authorization)*
