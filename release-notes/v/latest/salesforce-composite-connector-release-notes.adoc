The Anypoint Connector for Salesforce Composite provides a way to integrate with Salesforce Composite API link:https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_composite.htm[Salesforce Composite API]. The connector exposes convenient methods for preparing sub-requests, executing them in one batch, and parsing the results. It provides DataSense on both the preparation of sub-requests and parsing responses of their execution.

[[sco-connector-1.0.2]]
== 1.0.2

*March 15, 2018*

[[sco-connector-1.0.2-compatibility]]
=== Compatibility

The Salesforce Composite 1.0.2 connector is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime | 3.7.5 and later
|Salesforce Rest API | v36.0
|===

[[sco-connector-1.0.2-features]]
=== Features

* No new features added in this release.

[[sco-connector-1.0.2-fixes]]
=== Fixes

* SalesForce Composite Connector cannot retrieve metadata.
** The connector is able to connect to Salesforce without problems. But metadata is not refreshing in Studio and the timeout message is displayed. The problem occurs only for a Composite instance having big hierarchy of objects defined.
** Fixed by decreasing the depth level (=2) when computing metadata for objects/fields.

[[sco-connector-1.0.2-known-issues]]
=== Known Issues

* Support for TLS1.0 is discontinued in Salesforce.
* If by default the application tries to use TLS1.0, then when running it, the following VM argument should be added: -`Dhttp.protocols=TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2` - This ensures that TLS1.1 or TLS1.2 is used for communication with Salesforce.

[[sco-connector-1.0.1]]
== 1.0.1

*September 5, 2017*

[[sco-connector-1.0.1-compatibility]]
=== Compatibility

The Salesforce Composite 1.0.1 connector is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime | 3.7.5 and later
|Salesforce Rest API | v36.0
|===

[[sco-connector-1.0.1-features]]
=== Features

* *Addition of Proxy Support*: Starting with version 1.0.1 the Salesforce Composite Connector allows the connection using a PROXY.

[[sco-connector-1.0.1-fixes]]
=== Fixes

* *INVALID_SESSION_ID not triggering reconnection strategy:* Previously, when the Invalid Session Id exception occurred the reconnection strategy did not kick in as expected. Now, when such an exception occurs the reconnection strategy is successfully started.
* *Propagate errors from Salesforce Composite connector*: In previous versions, the exception handling for the Salesforce specific errors was hidden by the connector and no details about the error encountered was visible to the user. Now, error details such as status code and exception message are forwarded to the end user.

[[sco-connector-1.0.1-known-issues]]
=== Known Issues

* Support for TLS1.0 is discontinued in Salesforce.
* If by default the application tries to use TLS1.0, then, when running it, the following VM argument should be added: -Dhttp.protocols=TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2
This will ensure the fact that TLS1.1 or TLS1.2 will be used for the communication with Salesforce.
