= Mule ESB 3.1.3 Release Notes
:keywords: release notes, esb

The Mule team has worked hard to bring you Mule ESB 3.1.3. This follow-up release to link:/release-notes/mule-esb-3.1.2-release-notes[Mule ESB 3.1.2] continues MuleSoft's commitment to making Mule the industry's most powerful, simplest to use, and most up-to-date Open Source ESB. **Over 60 issues were fixed between this release and the previous one, making this release a highly recommended download---and the most stable version of our 3.1.x branch to date**.

== New in Mule ESB Version 3.1.3

=== Fixed a Memory Leak Involving Transformers and Dynamic Endpoints

We have eliminated a memory leak which occurred when Transformers and Dynamic Endpoints were used. Objects are now disposed off properly.

=== Message Properties Propagation Improvements

In this release we solved multiple problems regarding the handling of message properties through different Transports and Routers. We have added many tests to ensure that the problems do not reappear. We also invested much time to make sure that Mule ESB handles message properties consistently within Flows. If you encountered problems in this area with previous releases, please try out version 3.1.3.

For more about message properties, see: link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/message-property-scopes[Message Property Scopes].

=== Error Handling Consistency

We also devoted much effort to improving error handling consistency throughout Mule ESB. We uncovered and fixed many error handling inconsistencies across multiple components, particularly those related to Flows. If you rely on exception strategies to get the most out of ESB, version 3.1.3 should be your choice.

For additional details on error handling, see: link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/error-handling[Error Handling]

=== Multiple Fixes on JMS and WMQ Transport

We have resolved multiple issues involving the JMS and WMQ Transports. Transactionality and error handling now work as expected. The replyTo and request-response features now work consistently. We also fixed the feature that includes a Message Processor in the response chain. These fixes should prove critical if you use either the JMS or WMQ Transport.

For reference information on the JMS Transport, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/jms-transport-reference[JMS Transport Reference].

For details about the WMQ Transport, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/mule-wmq-transport-reference[WMQ Transport Reference].

For overview disscusion of Mule Transports, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/connecting-using-transports[Connecting Using Transports].
