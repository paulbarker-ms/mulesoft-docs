_Premium_

The Anypoint Connector for Siebel allows you to create connections to Oracle's Siebel customer relationship manager (CRM) from a Mule application.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The connector is actually comprised of _three_ modules, each used to connect to different Siebel objects:

* Oracle Siebel Business Objects: Create, update, upsert, query, and delete Siebel business components.
* Oracle Siebel Integration Objects: Create, update, upsert, query, delete, query page, execute, and synchronize Siebel integration objects.
* Oracle Siebel Business Services: Execute Siebel business services.

See the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/siebel-connector[Siebel Connector User Guide].

=== Migrating from Older Versions of the Connector

If you are currently using an older version of the connector, a small popup should appear in the bottom right corner of the Studio when opened saying something like `Updates Available`. Click that popup and check for available updates.

You should see one or more modules of the Siebel Connector (i.e. Oracle Siebel Business Objects Connector, Siebel Business Service Connector and Siebel Integration Objects Connector).

When you choose to install one of the connectors, a screen should appear prompting you to uninstall your old version of the connector and install the new one.

As shown in the images below, when choosing to install the Oracle Siebel Integration Objects Connector, the old version of the Siebel Connector (version 2.1.0) is uninstalled in the process.

image:install1.png[install1]

image:install2.png[install2]

After the installation is completed, we can use the Siebel Integration Objects Connector. To work with business services or business objects, the other two connectors have to be installed.
Please keep up to date and have the latest version of the Studio installed.

=== Features

* Added support for inserting/querying/deleting/updating attachments using integration objects. In order to work with attachments, the user must have an integration object that contains an attachment business component.
+
** Insert:
+
*** The attachment business component must have as a parent the business object the user wants to attach the document to. If the parent doesn’t exist, use the INSERT or UPSERT operation when inserting attachments. If the parent exists, use UPSERT.
*** The attachment business component has a field called ‘AttachmentContent’ that stores the attachment content. It accepts inputStream or byte[] as dataType.
*** The integration object used must have the ‘fileName’ field of its attachment component visible and enabled.
*** NOTE: When inserting attachments, make sure the flag fields for the attachment business component are correctly filled depending on your needs. When inserting documents from the UI, Siebel automatically fills these flag fields in the background when creating the attachment. Below is an example of a Siebel JSON message structure given as input for inserting an action attachment.
+
[source,code,linenums]
----
{
	"SiebelMessage": {
		"ListOfAction_IO": [
		{
			"Action": {
				"Activity UID" : "Test-UID",
				"Description" : "Mule Automation Tests New Siebel Action IO222",
				"ListOfAction Attachment":[
				{
					"Action Attachment": {
					"ActivityFileSrcType": "FILE",
					"ActivityFileExt": "png",
					"ActivityFileDeferFlg": "R",
					"ActivityFileName": "imageFile21w23",
					"ActivityFileSize": "1172"
					}
        }

				]
			}
		}
		]
	}
}
----
+
** Query:
+
*** When querying for attachments, use  the Siebel Integration Objects connector QUERY operation. Fill some information in the message structure for the parent object and the attachment to filter the response you receive.
*** If you query for attachments that do not have content, you receive a SQL exception.
*** The resulting attachment components contain a field called ‘AttachmentContent’ that contains the content for each attachment that was returned. See this query input example:
+
[source,code,linenums]
----
{
	SiebelMessage : {
		ListOfAction_IO :[{
			Action :{
				ListOfAction Attachment:{

					Action Attachment :{
						ActivityFileName : test-file-name,

				}

			}],
			Activity UID : test-activity-UID
			}
		}]
	}
}
----
+
** Update:
+
*** To update an attachment, use the Siebel Integration Objects connector UPSERT operation. Complete the key fields of the parent business object (the object that contains the attachment business component) and add new content to the attachment you desire to update.
*** Another way an attachment update can be performed is to use the “operation” field with the Siebel Integration Objects connector's EXECUTE operation. The parent business object has the “operation” field marked as upsert and the attachment that needs to be updated has the value of update. Here is an example of a message used as an input to update an action attachment:
+
[source,code,linenums]
----
{
	"SiebelMessage": {
		"ListOfAction_IO": [
		{
			"Action": {
				"Activity UID" : "Test-UID",
				"Description" : "Mule Automation Tests New Siebel Action IO222",
				"operation":"upsert"
				"ListOfAction Attachment":[
				{
					"Action Attachment":{
					"ActivityFileName":"test33",
					"Activity Id":"1-186C9"
					"AttachmentContent":UPDATED CONTENT,
					"operation":"update"
				}
					}

				]
			}
		}
		]
	}
}
----
+
** Delete:
+
*** To delete an attachment, use the Siebel Integration Objects connector EXECUTE operation. For the parent business object, set the operation field to UPSERT, and for the attachment you want to delete, set the operation field to DELETE.
*** Here is an example of a message structure used as input to delete an attachment: +
+
[source,code,linenums]
----
{
"SiebelMessage" : {
  "ListOfAction_IO" :[{
		"Action" :{
			"ListOfAction Attachment":{

				"Action Attachment" :{
					"ActivityFileName" : "test-file-name",
					"operation" : "delete"
				}

			}],
			"Activity UID" : "test-activity-UID",
			"operation" : "upsert"
		}
		}]
	}
}
----
+
* Added the “operation” field to the business objects and business components that make the integration object. Now, using the Siebel Integration Objects connector EXECUTE operation allows the executions of operations at a child component level. Some good examples are the ones given for the attachment update and delete.
* Added support for RSA encryption. Now, in the connector configuration there is a new checkbox that enables or disables the RSA encryption. By default it is set to false.
+
NOTE: Make sure your Siebel server allows RSA encryption before using it.
+
* It is now possible to control the number of records a Siebel Business Objects connector query returns.
** After choosing the “Query Business Components” operation of the Siebel Business Objects connector, a new field is available called “Number of records returned”. This field determines the number of records the query returns.
** By default, the field “Number of records returned” is empty and the query returns all the available records it finds. +

=== Fixed in this Release

Before, List was recognized as Map at DataSense in the Integration Objects. Now the problem is fixed.

=== Known Issues

Connector does not work with Siebel v7.5 and lower.

== 2.1.0

*April 13, 2014*

=== Compatibility

The Siebel connector is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service |Version
|Mule Runtime |v3.6.1 and later
|Siebel |v8.1
|===


The Siebel v2.1.0 connector is built and tested using Oracle Siebel 8.1. Because the Java Data Bean interface is generic, the Siebel v2.1.0 connector works with Siebel versions 7.7, 7.8, and 8.0. However, the compatibility of the connector with any other version beside 8.1 has not been tested. The connector is not compatible with Siebel v7.5 and earlier.

=== Features

* Added native library support for Mule projects created in Anypoint Studio without Maven. This lets you add the required Siebel JAR files from the Global Element configuration without using Maven, or installing the JAR locally and adding the dependency to the Project Object Model (POM).
* Migrated to Anypoint Connector DevKit v3.6.1. 

If you are already using a previous version of the Siebel connector, learn how to work link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/working-with-multiple-versions-of-connectors[with multiple versions of the connector].

=== Fixes

* Previously, the Accounts records in Siebel were not mapped to the Contact records. This issue has been fixed. 

== 2.0
