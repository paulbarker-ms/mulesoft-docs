== New Features and Enhancements

Beginning on December 15, 2017 the Anypoint Platform control plane is available in the European Union. This enables all customer and MuleSoft data remain entirely within the EU. 

This release includes the following new features and enhancements:

* EU control plane deployed in EU
* Runtime Manager supports deploying to applications to CloudHub hosted in the EU.
* The `amc_setup` command supports `eu1` as value of the `region` option. This enables you to connect a customer-managed Mule runtime to the EU control plane.
* Mule runtime includes changes to the `wrapper.conf` file and the command line that support connecting to the EU control plane.
* Support for Object Store v2.

To take advantage of assets available in the public Exchange of the US control plane, copy those assets to a private Exchange within the EU control plane. Private Exchange is fully supported in the EU control plane.

* When deploying to CloudHub, you can only deploy applications and gateways to the Frankfurt region. Additionally, the number of supported Mule runtime versions is smaller.

* Object Store v1 is not supported.

* Anypoint Platform users must create a separate account to access the EU control plane.

* You can only create dedicated load balancers and virtual private clouds (VPCs) in the Frankfurt region. The default name of the dedicated load balance in the EU control plane is `lb-prod-eu-rt.anypointdns.net`
