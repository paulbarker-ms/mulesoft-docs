== 8.6.0

*March 28, 2018*

=== Compatibility

Salesforce connector version 8.6.0 is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule Enterprise Edition 3.5.2 and later
|Anypoint Studio|Only works with Studio 5.4.0 and later
|Salesforce|v37.0, v38.0, v39.0, v40.0, v41.0
|===

=== Features

Added extra parameter bufferSizeInBytes for Replay Streaming Channel source.
User can set the internal buffer size for the message consumer. Default value is 26 MB.

=== Fixed in this Release

* Customer received no error or exception on 403::Organization total events daily limit exceeded.
+
In previous versions when 'error=403::Organization total events daily limit exceeded' occurred, 
the connector would throw an exception to let the customer know about this issue.
The connector now fires an event when the reconnection count is greater than 
10, but in case this never occurs, a custom notification is fired. The notification 
ID for this error is always 100888 and it also contains the appropriate message.
+
* Salesforce connector invoked REST apex and ignored null values.
+
When Salesforce connector invoke-apex-rest-method sends JSON to Salesforce, it ignores all null fields.
We need those null fields so we can update fields in Salesforce to null, otherwise Salesforce won't update those fields. 
+
* Salesforce Streaming flow when set to processingStrategy as Synchronous does not catch exception strategy.
+
Using Salesforce connector with operation "Replay Streaming Channel" as message listener and explicitly 
specifying the flow processing strategy as "synchronous" does not forward the exception thrown to the 
exception strategy defined. Whereas if no processingStrategy is defined in the flow then the exception 
is handled by the exception strategy.
+
* Salesforce topic disconnected when proxy with CONNECT.
+
Using previous versions to subscribe to a Salesforce Topic will fail with exception when the connection goes throw a proxy.
The bug is documented here: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=475546. Fixed by upgrading to jetty-9.2.24.
+
* CVE Security Vunerabilities in jackson-databind-2.4.3.
+
CVE-2017-7525 jackson-databind: Deserialization vulnerability via readValue method of ObjectMapper See `+https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1462702+` and `+https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7525+`.
Upgraded to 2.9.4 jackson-databind dependency.

== 8.5.0

*February 22, 2018*

This release adds support for Salesforce API v41.0.

=== Compatibility

Salesforce connector version 8.5.0 is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service |Version
|Mule Runtime |Mule Enterprise Edition 3.5.2 and later
|Anypoint Studio |Only works with Studio 5.4.0 and later
|Salesforce |v37.0, v38.0, v39.0, v40.0, v41.0
|===

=== Features

The connector is now updated to support the new Salesforce API v41.0.

== 8.4.1

*January 19, 2018*

=== Compatibility

Salesforce connector version 8.4.1 is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule Enterprise Edition 3.5.2 and later
|Anypoint Studio|Only works with Studio 5.4.0 and later
|Salesforce|v37.0, v38.0, v39.0, v40.0
|===

=== Fixed in this Release

* SFDC Connector: Buffering capacity exceeded. In previous versions, low buffering capacity could cause the capacity to be exceeded when several events have been queued. Now, the buffering capacity has been increased.
* Reply topic losing messages. In previous versions, when there's a network failure for less than 40 seconds (the amount of time needed to pass so that a resubscription to the topic triggers) and there are events that are sent for the pending HTTP request, those events are lost. Currently a resubscription is triggered when the connection is lost.

== 8.4.0

*October 26, 2017*

This version of the Salesforce connector provides support for Salesforce v40.0 and new operations.

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule Enterprise Edition 3.5.2 and later
|Anypoint Studio|Only works with Studio 5.4.0 and later
|Salesforce|v37.0, v38.0, v39.0, v40.0
|===

=== Features

* Added support for Salesforce API v40.0.
* Support for publishing platform event messages using the http://mulesoft.github.io/mule-salesforce-connector/8.4.0/apidocs/apidoc.html#_publish_platform_event_message[Publish platform event message] operation.
* Added new metadata types
* Provided new operations for http://mulesoft.github.io/mule-salesforce-connector/8.4.0/apidocs/apidoc.html#_convert_lead[Convert lead], http://mulesoft.github.io/mule-salesforce-connector/8.4.0/apidocs/apidoc.html#_find_duplicates_by_ids[Find duplicates by ids], http://mulesoft.github.io/mule-salesforce-connector/8.4.0/apidocs/apidoc.html#_change_own_password[Change own password]

=== Fixed in this Release

* Apex SOAP call did not work when reconnection was triggered. In previous versions when the session was invalidated, the connector threw an error with this message `Failed to invoke invokeApexSoapMethod` caused by the `org.apache.cxf.binding.soap.SoapFault No operation specified in request (the Body element has no child elements)` exception. With this fix, the payload is retained and the calls work correctly after the reconnection.
 * There was a leak when the Salesforce connector performed a reconnection. In previous versions when the Salesforce connector performed a reconnection, HttpClient objects were leaking. With this fix, there are no leaks when reconnecting.
 * No error received by clients when the Organization total events daily limit was exceeded. In the previous version when there was an error of type `403::Organization`, the total events daily limit exceeded the connector and did not throw an error or exception. In current version besides throwing an exception a notification is fired. The notification ID for this error is always be 100888 and it also contains the appropriate message. 

== 8.3.1

*July 3, 2017*

Salesforce connector version 8.3.1 is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule Enterprise Edition 3.5.2 and later
|Anypoint Studio|Only works with Studio 5.4.0 and later
|Salesforce|v37.0, v38.0, v39.0
|===

=== Fixed in this Release

* *Failure to refresh metadata*: In the previous version _Refresh Metadata_ failed when references (__r) were used in a *SELECT* statement. Currently statements like: `SELECT a.OtherObject_r.CustomFieldc FROM MyCustomObject_c a' should work.

* *Salesforce topic subscription failure with API v37 v38 and v39*: In previous version/s, in long-running salesforce applications subscribed to a topic it threw a _org.cometd.3_0_10.shade.common.TransportException: {httpCode=404}_. Currently, after a proper configuration, topic subscription shouldn't fail after a long-running. Check https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/salesforce-connector#subscribing-to-a-topic[User Manual - Subscribing to a Topic]

Salesforce connector version 8.2.1 is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule Enterprise Edition 3.5.2 and later
|Anypoint Studio|Only works with Studio 5.4.0 and later
|Salesforce|v37.0, v38.0
|===

=== Fixed in this Release

* In the previous version 8.2.0, the name of the parameter given to operations that were expecting an object of type BatchInfo as input was changed from `batch-info` to `batch-to-retrieve`, which affected  existing apps using those operations. In version 8.2.1 `batch-to-retrieve` has been changed back to `batch-info` and `batch-to-retrieve` has been removed.

Example of operation using `batch-to-retrieve`:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sfdc:batch-info config-ref="Salesforce__Basic_Authentication" doc:name="Salesforce">
    <sfdc:batch-to-retrieve ref="#[payload]"/>
</sfdc:batch-info>
----

In version 8.2.1, this operation has been changed back to how it was in the past:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sfdc:batch-info config-ref="Salesforce__Basic_Authentication" doc:name="Salesforce">
    <sfdc:batch-info ref="#[payload]"/>
</sfdc:batch-info>
----

|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule Enterprise Edition 3.5.2 and later
|Anypoint Studio|Only works with Studio 5.4.0 and later
|Salesforce|v37.0, v38.0
|===

=== Features

* Added new configuration which is using OAuth2.0 Username-Password authentication flow, see: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_understanding_username_password_oauth_flow.htm[Username-Password OAuth Authentication Flow].
* Added support for providing custom headers in the *Create Job* operation that provides behavior similar to "PK Chunking", see: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/async_api_headers_enable_pk_chunking.htm[PK Chunking Header].
* Added support for providing custom headers on *Query Result Stream* that lets you set headers on request. This can be useful if you want, for example, to receive data in GZIP format by adding "Accept-Encoding=GZIP" as a header.
* Added support for providing custom headers on *Batch Result Stream* that lets you set headers on request. This can be useful if you want, for example, to receive data in GZIP format by adding "Accept-Encoding=GZIP" as a header.

=== Fixed in this Release

* When the connector was used as an inbound endpoint in case of a session expiration, it wasn't able to refresh the session, but now is fixed.

== 8.1.0

*December 2, 2016*

=== Compatibility

Salesforce connector version 8.1.0 is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule Enterprise Edition 3.5.2 and later
|Anypoint Studio|Only works with Studio 5.4.0 and later
|Salesforce|v37.0, v38.0
|===

=== Features

* Added a new Salesforce header to the list of headers, which is DuplicateRuleHeader, that are accepted by create(), update(), upsert() and from now on, by findDuplicates()
* Added support for find duplicates API core call. See: link:https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_calls_findduplicates.htm#sforce_api_calls_findduplicates[Find Duplicates Core Call]
* Added enhancements to the Streaming API. The connector stores the replay ID for the last processed event. The user now has the possibility to replay all unprocessed events within the 24 hour time-frame provided by Salesforce. The replay ID can now be specified as a MEL expression.
* Added support for Batch Info List bulk API call. See: link:https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.202.0.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/asynch_api_batches_get_info_all.htm[Get Information for All Batches in a Job]

* From now on, exception is thrown instead of hanging when a header from response is not recognized. (For example, for this use case: when a proxy is altering response from Salesforce.)
* Proxy configuration was not taken in consideration by streaming inbound endpoints, fixed it.
* When domain name was containing word "services" (for example, `+https://services--dev.salesforce.com/services/c/38.0+`) the computation of service endpoint to which upcoming requests are send was wrong, so it was fixed.

=== Known Issues

* "Resume from the last replay id” won’t work on Cloudhub because the persistent object store is not supported by Cloudhub.

* Added new icons for the Studio Light Theme.
* When fetching the metadata for Apex Rest Classes, if an exception is thrown for an Apex Class, the metadata is fetched for the other Apex classes, and that exception will be logged. A MetadataKey is created for that Apex Class that presents the exception message.

=== Fixed in this Release

* Reconnection Strategy now works if the session was invalidated when invoking an Apex Rest Class.
* Corrected an issue that caused Salesforce Connector to fail in extracting the access token from the Salesforce Oauth response.

* Now the connector supports a trial version. This means that Salesforce Connector can be used with an evaluation/trial license for Mule EE
* Added JSON support for Bulk API operations
* Validate Configuration can now verify if the current session is valid
* Validations are performed on Invoke Apex Rest Method to verify that restMethodName has the expected format


=== Fixed in this Release

== 7.0.1

*December 9, 2015*

=== Compatibility

Salesforce connector version 7.0.1 is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule Enterprise Edition 3.5.2 and later
|Anypoint Studio|Only works with Studio 5.4.0 and later
|Salesforce|v32.0 to v34.0
|===


=== Fixed in this Release

* Fixed how the way query results are returned. Exceptions related to "No converter found!" are no longer thrown for inner selects (for child relationships).
* Because the converters introduced a huge impact on production performance it was decided that all fields are to be returned as Strings and DataWeave will be used for data transformation.
* Batch Operation Results are reported correctly now, if Batch Commit component is used. Before the connector had problems reporting how many records were successful and how many where failed (all the recors were reported as successful).
* Invocation of Apex Rest methods that are void no longer fails.

=== Known Issues

* Batch Operation Results report all records as successful when the Batch Commit component is not used (only the Batch Step component is used).

== 7.0.0

*December 1, 2015*

=== Compatibility

Salesforce connector version 7.0.0 is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule Enterprise Edition 3.5.2 and later
|Anypoint Studio|Only works with Studio 5.4.0 and later
|Salesforce|v32.0 to v34.0
|===

This is a *major version* change, hence the connector *might break backward compatibility* for some existing flows.
It uses DevKit 3.7 and its new features (like multi-level Datasense for invokeApexSoapMethod and invokeApexRestMethod) and dates are no longer passed as String, but as Dates and Calendars. To see how the new metadata key ids are formed for invokeApexSoapMethod and invokeApexRestMethod please read below.

=== Features

* The connector now supports versions 32.0 to 34.0 of the Salesforce API.
* *get-session-id*
** Added an extra optional input parameter to this operation, that forces the session validation.
* *describe-global* and *describe-sobject*
** Added an extra optional parameter to these operations in order to add Salesforce SOAP headers on the requests.
* *invoke-apex-rest-method*
** Added support for Custom Types and Apex Custom Types
** Added multilevel Datasense (the user has to choose the Apex Class first and then in a following parameter, the user must choose a Method Name from the ones available for that class)
** The resulting metadata key id will have the following format:
'apexClassName||apexMethodName\^resourceUrl^httpMethod\^outputType^inputParameters'
where
*** apexClassName is the value chosen by the user for the "Apex Class" parameter under the General section of the connector tab;
*** apexMethodName is the value chosen by the user for the "Method Name" parameter under this General section;
*** resourceUrl is the value of urlMapping attribute from the '@RestResource' annotation of the apex class;
*** httpMethod is the http method annotation of the Apex Rest resource (for example, @HttpGet, @HttpPost) without the '@' symbol;
*** outputType is the method output type (for example, 'List<Account>');
*** inputParameters is a comma separated list of input parameters (their name and their type - for example, 'account=Account, someParameter=String');
*** '||' is a separator used between the class name and the method name;
*** '^' is a separator for the method details.
* *invoke-apex-soap-method*
** Added multilevel Datasense (the user has to choose the Apex Class first and then in a following parameter, the user must choose a Method Name from the ones available for that class)
** The resulting metadata key ID will have the following format: 'apexClassName||apexMethodName' where:
*** apexClassName is the value chosen by the user for the "Apex Class" parameter under the General section of the connector tab;
*** apexMethodName is the value chosen by the user for the "Method Name" parameter under this General section;
*** '||' is a separator used between the class name and the method name.
* Changed *Test Connection* to *Validate Configuration* and added a validation for Apex Classes and Proxy configurations if these are set in the connector configuration.
* *merge*
** This is a new operation to support merging of accounts.
* *reset-password*
** This is a new operation to offer support to users wanting to reset their password through the connector.
* Added the ability to use external IDs in metadata (DataMapper or DataWeave).
* Added support for List<String> for fieldsToNull.

=== Fixed in this Release

* Changed the creation of the URLs used for Apex SOAP and Apex REST requests, in order to support reverse proxies.
* Modified some Java documentation that incorrectly appeared as explanations in Studio elements like configurations.
* Corrected the parsing of dates from Apex REST invocation responses.
* Added validation for the existence of IDs when using the *retrieve* operation, to avoid possible exception thrown when it is called.
* Dates are now returned as Calendars rather than Strings, for easier use (comparison or alteration).
* Fixed issue with Apex REST URL not supporting certain characters like period ('.').
* Improved overall performance for Apex REST invocation by avoiding the download and parsing of the Apex REST class at every invocation; instead we are relying on the information obtained during Datasense and data stored in the metadata key id related to the method to be invoked.
//TODO: confirm wording in above bullet point was meant to be "settings" not "set", which did not make sense.
* Removed default proxy port from the configuration as it is confusing.
* Handle the Salesforce Address type as an object in metadata rather than a String, as before.

=== Known Issues

* This version of the connector breaks backward compatibility:
** the way some metadata key ids are created was changed due to some performance enhancements (invokeApexSoapMethod and invokeApexRestMethod are affected by this).
** the way the connector works with Dates has been changed: dates are no longer expected/returned as Strings; they are used as Dates or Calendars, for easier use (comparison and calculations), depending on their types.
* Salesforce has a know issue with creating correct WSDLs for the Apex SOAP classes created under version 34.0 and 35.0 of the API. As a workaround Salesforce suggested that the Apex SOAP classes should be created under version 32.0 to be able to use them.
* For versions v28.0, v29.0 of the Salesforce API use version v5.4.12 of the connector.


== 6.2.3

*July 23, 2015*

=== Fixed in This Release

* Fixed an error where session expiration would not be handled correctly even with a reconnection strategy set, in operations that returned a SalesforcePagingDelegate (query, queryall).

*July 22, 2015*

=== Fixed in This Release

* A bug that logged warning messages as errors once a session expired even if you had reconnection on has been fixed.
