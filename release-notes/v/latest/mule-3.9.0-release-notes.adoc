= Mule Runtime 3.9.0 Release Notes
:keywords: mule, 3.9.0, runtime, release notes

*October 6, 2017*

Mule Runtime 3.9.0 is focused on customer requested enhancements and bug fixes. +
This release allows you to:

* Support for PGP signatures in Anypoint Enterprise Security
* Certificate revocation list support for TLS configurations.
* Communicate with FTP and SFTP servers via proxy.
* Configure Mule to work with external Hazelcast servers for Anypoint Fabric.
* Write database queries using the ‘WITH’ operator.
* Process messages with non-blocking processing strategy and one way flows.
* Speed startup times with parallel deployment support.

Additionally, this version of the API Gateway introduces mechanisms for alleviating disaster recovery conditions. +

* Gatekeeper is now able to use the last known state of each tracked API.
:: If at initialization time, Anypoint API Platform is unreachable for any reason, the runtime will use the last known state of each tracked API (ie applied policies and registered API Contracts before the disaster condition), until connection is reestablished again; in which case the normal cyclic reconciliation mechanism will be triggered. +
This Gatekeeper functionality also works on Cloudhub workers.
* Deploying or redeploying an app now runs a reconciliation cycle, independently from the general reconciliation mechanism.
:: This behavior is introduced for the benefit of customers that have long reconciliation cycles and when deploying or redeploying an app have to wait a long time for policies to be applied or restart the runtime itself. +
Both reconciliation mechanisms follow BackOff and BackOn rules to make connection attempts. Logs were also improved to show this with fine grained details.


== Software Compatibility Testing

Mule was tested on the following software:

[%header,cols="15a,85a"]
|===
|Software |Version
|JDK | JDK 1.8.0 (Recommended JDK 1.8.0_144)
|OS |MacOS 10.11.x, HP-UX 11i V3, AIX 7.2, Windows 2016 Server, Windows 10, Solaris 11.3, RHEL 7, Ubuntu Server 16.04
|Application Servers |Tomcat 7, Tomcat 8, Weblogic 12c, Wildfly 8, Wildfly 9, Websphere 8, Jetty 8, Jetty 9
|Databases |Oracle 11g, Oracle 12c, MySQL 5.5+, DB2 10, PostgreSQL 9, Derby 10, Microsoft SQL Server 2014
|===

API Gateway is compatible with the following software:

* APIkit 3.9.0
* Anypoint Studio 6.4.0

== Changes

*Flow*

* The initialState property of a flow now supports a property placeholder.
:: You can set The initalState of a flow using a property placeholder such as:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="trigger" initialState="${flow.state}"/>
----
+
And define this placeholder from the `mule-app.properties` file:
+
[source]
----
flow.state=stopped
----
+
This is helpful when working in a disaster-recovery environment.

*HTTP  Listener*

* Support CRL in the HTTP listener.
:: Implement certificate validation through revocation lists for clients connecting to the HTTP listener.
* Support flag ``-Dmule.timeout.disable=true` in HTTP Listeners.
:: Disable timeout when listening to external resources.

*Remote Hazelcast*

* Support for using clusttering in remote fashion.

*Java Service Wrapper*

* Change the default tanuki timeout action
:: When the wrapper detects a timeout in the ping to the runtime, it will generate a DUMP and then restart in place of just restart as it was done before. This is useful for troubleshooting purposes.

== Bundled Runtime Manager Agent

This version of Mule runtime comes bundled with the Runtime Manager Agent plugin version 1.9.0.

See link:/release-notes/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes].

== Anypoint Private Cloud Edition Support

This release is supported on Anypoint Private Cloud Edition 1.6.1 and later.

== Community Edition Migration to Mule 3.9.0

When migrating to Mule 3.9.0, follow the implicit and explicit guidelines related to these issues:

[%header,cols="25a,75a"]
|===
|Issue |Description
| MULE-12245 | 	Old Xalan and Xerces implementations were removed in favor of the newer versions included in Java. Only minor incompatibilities could result such as ordering changes of some XML attributes.
| MULE-12017 | 	log4j was updated from 2.5 to 2.8.2 and slf4j from 1.7.7 to 1.7.24. There is a minor incompatibility with code using logger.error(null, "message", e), in which case the first null argument should be omitted.
| MULE-11948 | 	Saxon was upgraded from 9.6.0-7 to 9.6.0-10
| MULE-9931	| Transaction log files size are now restricted by size, using a default size of 500 mb. The configured size is just an approximated value which may be exceeded based on the size of the record store by the transaction. This is configurable using the attribute queueTransactionFilesSize of the <configuration> element. +
The size restriction applies to the set of transaction log files for local transactions and XA transactions independently meaning that if both types of transactions are used for queue the set of tx files will use up to 1 gb."
| MULE-10100 | 	Processing after a synchronous until successful resulting in a VoidMuleEvent will now continue with the original event.
| MULE-10306 | 	XML entity expansion in XML transformers is now disabled by default because it allows DoS attacks. To restore previous behaviour use the expandInternalEntities="true" attribute.
| MULE-10686 | 	XML entity expansion in Jersey is now disabled by default because it allows DoS attacks. To restore previous behaviour use the mule.xml.expandInternalEntities=true property.
| MULE-10979 | 	The default response timeout and default transaction timeout can't be configured using system properties on the command line or in the wrapper.conf file anymore. In replacement, use the configuration element. For example: <configuration defaultResponseTimeout="20000"  defaultTransactionTimeout="40000"/>.
| MULE-11118 | 	The HTTP listener now replies with status code 503 when the thread pool is exhausted (and poolExhaustedAction="ABORT") instead of closing the socket.
| MULE-11825 | 	In a DB template query, to set a DB param with the null value, you can use the "NULL" literal value. For example: <db:in-param name="name" defaultValue="NULL"/>
| MULE-12385 | 	Reconnection Strategies can only be defined in connector components or globally (using <configuration> element). In mule 3.x, defining reconnection strategies was being supported by the XSD, but ignored by Runtime. Now, the XSD was changed to not allow to use this invalid configuration.
| MULE-12612 | 	As FTP reconnection is at operation level, FTP connector does not support asynchronous reconnection strategies because it only makes sense if reconnection takes place during the start phase of the connector lifecycle. In case you use this kind of reconnection, please change them as follows: <reconnect blocking="true"/> inside FTP Connector, or just remove the blocking attribute.
| MULE-13164 | 	Inconsistent null return from one-way VM inbound endpoint. From Mule 3.9 one-way inbound VM endpoints will now consistently return null to Flow using a request-response outbound endpoint or Mule Client using send(). (In previous versions a successful response led to null return yet an error resulted in a message being returned.)
| MULE-11246 | 	The secretAliasId parameter isn't mandatory anymore. If not given, Mule will take the secretAliasId from the message to decrypt. Additionally, from 3.9.x the secretAliasId must be an hexadecimal value.
| MULE-11161 | 	The default PGP Encryption algorithm has been changed from CAST5 to AES 256.
