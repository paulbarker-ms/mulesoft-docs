== 4.4.0

June 20, 2017

This is a minor release that includes one new feature.

=== New Features

* MongoDB Java Driver Update - The connector is updated with MongoDB Java Driver v3.6.0.

==  4.3.0

December 28, 2017

This is a minor release that includes one new feature and two bug fixes.

===  New Features

* SNI Support - The connector now supports SNI for TLS connections, provided that the user updates to Java version 1.8 update 131 or greater.

===  Fixed in this Release

* BsonInvalidOperationException on upsert operations - Under certain scenarios, the connector threw `org.bson.BsonInvalidOperationException: Value expected to be of type OBJECT_ID is of unexpected type STRING` when upserting documents, if the _id was not of type ObjectId. This now works as expected.
* InvalidLicenseException when config is in a domain - Mule apps calling the Mongo connector that had its config in a domain would randomly throw `InvalidLicenseException`. This was fixed.

=== Known Issues

* When connecting to a MongoDB instance that requires SNI, the Test Connectivity functionality in Studio may not work. The connector will still work despite this.

== 4.2.0

* Connection String Authentication: Connector now supports standard MongoDB connection URI format used to connect to a MongoDB database server.
* Separate authentication database support: This version supports a collection of users/passwords to authenticate against a MongoDB database different from MongoDB database storing data.

=== Fixed in this Release

* Fixed an issue where non-fully-qualified DNS names in *Hosts* field did not let you connect to MongoDB.

== 4.0.2

December 14, 2015

Release notes for version 4.0.2 of the MongoDB connector.

This is a minor release with a few bug fixes.

=== Fixed in this Release

- Fixed issue where if DataWeave output was set as JSON, MongoDB Connector could not transform it into the required input for the next processor.
- Fixed an issue with DataWeave, where static metadata could not let you use file manipulation processors.
- Added support for implicit transformers when running Mule ESB 3.6.X.
- Fixed documentation issues.

== 4.0.1

September 24, 2015

Release Notes for version 4.0.1 of the MongoDB connector.

This is a minor release with only one bug fix.

=== Fixed in this Release

- Fixed transformer resolution bug
- When using DataWeave for creating a payload with an object to insert into MongoDB, an implicit transformer
should take place and create the Document object that is passed on to the Insert Document processor. This creation was not picked up and it was not working.

== 4.0.0
