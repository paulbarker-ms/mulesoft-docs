== Migration Guide

This section presents configuration considerations you may want to adjust when migrating from a previous version of a Mule runtime, or previous version of Studio. Contact MuleSoft if you have a question about a specific migration activity or concern.

From the previous versions of Studio (5.1.1, 5.2.0, 5.2.1, to 5.3.0) there is no special migration needed, but when coming from older versions, it's recommended that you create a new workspace to host projects built with this new version. When opening a previous Workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project. Note that performing this conversion might imply loosing previously defined run configurations.

[NOTE]
Studio as an Eclipse plugin only works with Eclipse 4.3 or 4.4 due to an SWT dependency.

[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.

Then specify the location of your old version of Anypoint Studio in your local drive.
