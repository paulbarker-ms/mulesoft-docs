:keywords: release notes, esb


The second maintenance release for Mule 2.0 includes new support for parodying Web services, stream-based XPath routing, a more efficient http://www.mulesource.org/jira/browse/MULE-3466[XSLT engine], major improvements to the http://www.mulesource.org/jira/browse/MULE-3484[Jetty transport] and http://www.mulesource.org/jira/browse/MULE-2713[Scripting module], as well as a number of fixes/improvements for CXF, Transactions, Notifications, and more.

Two new examples have been added: "Bookstore" which illustrates CXF and "Change Machine" which illustrates Scripting using Groovy and Python. And although there's still much to do, significant progress has been made towards updating the User Guide and Schema Annotations for Mule 2.0.
