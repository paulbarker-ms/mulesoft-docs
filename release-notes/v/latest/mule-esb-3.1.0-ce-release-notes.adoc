= Mule ESB 3.1.0 CE Release Notes
:keywords: release notes

The Mule team is please to announce the availability of Mule 3.1. This is a follow-up release to **Mule 3.0.1**, which continues MuleSoft's commitment to making Mule the industry's most powerful, simplest to use, and up-to-date Open Source ESB.

[NOTE]
In previous versions of Mule, you were required to set the MULE_HOME environment variable in order for Mule to start. As of version 3.1, the MULE_HOME variable is not required. If you have an existing MULE_HOME variable pointing to a previous version of Mule, you may see inconsistent results. Therefore, if you have previously set this variable, you should unset it.

= New in Mule ESB Version 3.1

== Mule Cloud Connect

*Mule Cloud Connect* enables simple integration of cloud-based applications and data without any programming. Mule 3.1 includes major improvements to *Cloud Connect*, including custom schemas for each connector, much simpler invocation of connectors, a new polling mechanism, link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/mql-enrich-data[message enrichment] capabilities, and a simple yet powerful logging facility. Cloud connectors can also access the full range of Mule expressions allowing for very powerful integration and orchestration without any coding.

== Web Services

Mule 3 dramatically simplified SOAP web services in Mule with the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/simple-service-pattern[Simple Service] configuration pattern and a new implementation of CXF leveraging the Mule 3 message processor architecture. In 3.1, Mule's link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/cxf-module-reference[CXF support] has been upgraded to use the most recent version of CXF, 2.3.0. Support for the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/supported-web-service-standards[WS-Stack] was also improved. Most notably, Mule now supports WS-ReliableMessaging and asynchronous reply to endpoints for WS-Addressing. Validation of web services has also been enhanced. You can now turn on validation of incoming SOAP messages with CXF through a new _validationEnabled_ configuration attribute.

== Security Updates

In Mule 3.1, link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/configuring-security[Spring Security] has been upgraded from 2.0.4 to 3.0.3. This should be transparent to Mule configurations, except in two areas:

* Schema changes
* Java package changes

For more information on how to update your applications, refer to link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/configuring-security[Configuring Security] and the link:/release-notes/legacy-mule-migration-notes[Migration Guide].

== BPM Integration

Mule provides strong orchestration capabilities via the new Flow configuration in Mule 3 for short-lived transaction, where the goal is to maximize throughput and scalability. For other use cases like long running transaction, Mule has long included link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/bpm-transport-reference[BPM Module Reference] between Mule, commercial and open source BPM vendors (like jBPM, Activiti, BonitaSoft BPM, etc.).

In these release the Mule team has worked on the following integrations:

=== jBPM Integration

A jBPM business process is now a component in Mule rather than a transport, this not only enable the use case when we are connecting to an external BPM engine but also enable the use case when using jBPM "inside" Mule to process messages. Incoming messages to the component automatically advance the process, and the running process can send messages to any outbound endpoint. For more info., refer to link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/bpm-transport-reference[BPM Module Reference].

=== Activiti Integration

The Mule team has been busy contributing to the Activiti BPM project and will be releasing support in Mule 3 for Activiti very soon. For more information about link:http://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/mule-dev/activiti-mule-esb-part-1/[Activiti Integration]

== Mule ESB Management Console - Enterprise Edition

* *Deployment support*: Remotely provision applications to a group of Mule servers with a few clicks. Use a single tool for deployment to enable DevOps-style collaboration between development and operations. Reduce risks by promoting smaller and more frequent change.
* I**ntegrated Application Repository:** Store multiple Mule applications in a central repository, including version and history information.
* *Dashboards:* Monitor your entire system from a single customized screen. Create dashboards at the global and individual server levels. Consolidate raised alerts, server health/metrics, and application/deployment status on a single screen.
* *Role base authorization:* Segment users into groups based on role. Define role-based access capabilities. Maintain consistent view of infrastructure across development and operations, while reducing the risk of unauthorized actions
* *Versioning backward compatibility agent:* The latest Mule ESB Management Console is backward compatible with Mule 2.2.x, so you can manage all your Mule Servers from a single console, regardless what version of Mule you are running.

== Bug Fixes

Mule 3.1 also includes fixes for over 40 bugs. Details can be found in the link:/release-notes/mule-esb-3.1.0-ce-release-notes[release notes]. As usual, several of these were patches submitted by the Mule user community and we thank you for your contributions to making Mule a great product!
 
Other important changes in this release:

* Support for Spring Security v3
* Asynchronous reply to endpoints for link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/enabling-ws-addressing[WS-Addressing]
* WS-ReliableMessaging support
* You can now turn on validation of incoming SOAP messages with CXF through a new "validationEnabled" configuration attribute

=== Migration from Previous Versions

For instructions on migrating from a previous version, consult the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/release-and-migration-notes[Mule Migration page].

== Fixed in this Release

Mule Community Edition version 3.1 builds on the features added in version 3.0 and fixes the following issues. In addition, all the fixes from previous 3.1 milestones are included.
