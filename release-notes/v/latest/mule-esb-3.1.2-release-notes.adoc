= Mule ESB 3.1.2 Release Notes
:keywords: release notes, esb

The Mule team is proud to announce the availability of Mule ESB 3.1.2. This is a follow-up release to link:/release-notes/mule-esb-3.1.1-release-notes[Mule ESB 3.1.1], which continues MuleSoft's commitment to making Mule the industry's most powerful, simplest to use, and up-to-date Open Source ESB. **Over 60 issues were fixed between this release and the previous one, making this release a highly recommended download and more stable version**.

[NOTE]
In previous versions of Mule ESB, you were required to set the MULE_HOME environment variable in order for Mule to start. As of version 3.1, the MULE_HOME variable is not required. If you have an existing MULE_HOME variable pointing to a previous version of Mule, you may see inconsistent results. Therefore, if you have previously set this variable, you should unset it.

== New in Mule ESB Version 3.1.2

=== Per-App Log Files

Application logging has been the number one requested feature in Mule since the Mule 3 deployment model was introduced and it is now available. This feature enables you to keep more granular track of messages produced, increasing ease of development and ease of deployment.

Now you can fine-tune the logging for each application you are running in Mule. This is highly useful if you have multiple applications running and you need each one logging events at different levels to application-specific log files. You can also dynamically modify the logging configuration for each application at runtime. So if you want to track down an issue, you don't need to restart your application or server to change the level of your logs. Just change your application log config (typically through your log4j.properties file), and it starts logging with the new settings.

You can read more details about this on link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/logging-with-mule-esb-3.x[Logging with Mule ESB 3.X].

=== RESTlets Supported by Mule ESB

RESTlets are a set of Java classes that greatly simplify the hosting of multiple applications within a single JVM. The goal is to provide a RESTful, portable, and more flexible alternative to the existing Servlet API. In addition to support for Jersey, you can create RESTlet-based services. (This is a community library and doesn't ship with Mule.) You can download the 1.3 version from link:https://repository.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org/mule/transports/mule-transport-restlet/1.3/[here].

This project was also supported by members of the community.
