*October, 2016*

Anypoint Exchange Private Cloud Edition takes the power of cloud-based Anypoint Exchange and enables companies to manage Exchange from their site.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because this is a private version of Anypoint Exchange, you cannot see the public content available in the Cloud Version.  Accessing Exchange from Anypoint Studio does not work with the Private Cloud Edition Exchange. When you first start the customer-managed version of Exchange, no content displays:

This Anypoint Exchange release includes the following new features and functionality:

* Create and Publish private content: Choose between a variety of content types (templates, examples, connectors, and more) to add, describe your asset, and publish it in your organization’s exchange. Only the people you choose may have access to create and publish new content.

* Search for Content: Users within your organization can find the internally published content (as well as MuleSoft’s public content), increasing the chance of reuse and avoiding redundant work. Exchange Admins can customize search filters to make internal content easier to find.

=== Known Issues

To access private content from Anypoint Studio, version 4.2.0 or newer must be used.
