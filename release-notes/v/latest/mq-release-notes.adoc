*August 27, 2016*

This release of Anypoint MQ contains the following features:

* link:/anypoint-mq/mq-queues#about-dead-letter-queues[Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)] feature enables a queue to receive undeliverable messages.
* Bug fixes and UI improvements.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Anypoint MQ API lets you configure a queue to be its own dead letter queue; however, the MQ user interface does not let a queue to be its own DLQ, only the REST API permits this. MuleSoft recommends that you do not do this except for testing purposes because if left in production, this can result in infinite retries thus causing a client application to burn through its monthly usage quota quickly.
