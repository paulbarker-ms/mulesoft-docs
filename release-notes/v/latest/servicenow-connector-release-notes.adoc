For ServiceNow connector v4.0 to function properly, the namespace for locally declared elements must be qualified by the target namespace. Make the following change in your ServiceNow instance to do so:

. Go to *System Properties* > *Web Services*.
. Click *Properties*.
. De-select the *YES|NO* box for the *elementFormDefault* property as shown below.

Note that the box is selected by default, setting the *elementFormDefault* property to *true*.   By de-selecting the box, we set the property to *false* thereby specifying that locally declared elements must be qualified by the target namespace.
