= Anypoint Studio July 2014 with 3.5.1 Runtime Release Notes
:keywords: release notes, anypoint studio

*<<Migration Guide, Skip to Migration Guide>>*

*July 14, 2014*

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the release of *Anypoint Studio July 2014 with 3.5.1 Runtime*.

[NOTE]
Upgrading from an existing instance of Anypoint Studio or previous Mule runtime version? Refer to the <<Migration Guide>>.

== Current Release Versions

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|  |*Enterprise Runtime*
|*ESB Runtime* |Version: 3.5.1
|*Anypoint** Studio* |Version: July 2014 +
Build Number: 201407140931
|*Anypoint DevKit* |Version: 3.5.1
|*APIkit* |Version: 1.4.1
|*Management Console* |Version: 3.5.1
|*SAP Connector* |Version: 2.2.2
|===

== New Features and Functionality

Our new version of Anypoint Studio (formerly known as Mule Studio) functions as a single download and includes the 3.5.1 runtime with an Enterprise trial license. It includes the following new features:

* *Anypoint Templates*: Browse the library on https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?type=template[Anypoint Exchange] or within Anypoint Studio to find templates that help you rapidly integrate systems.
* *Streamlined package explorer and no more mflow files*: We’ve simplified how you access your Mule flows and improved Studio’s ability to work with source control systems. Mflow files are no longer needed, and all Mule configuration files can be accessed through `src/main/app`.
* *What’s New & Migration Wizard*: When updating Studio or downloading the new version, a What's New dialog presents key migration information. In addition, a migration wizard helps you update your existing projects to reflect the adjustments to the project file structure.
* *Connector Driver configuration*: You can now easily configure JDBC or SAP drivers from the global connector configuration window and receive project errors when drivers are configured incorrectly.
* *DataSense Improvements*: DataSense retrieves metadata at a faster speed in this release. You can also easily clear the metadata cache by right-clicking a connector and clicking *Clear DataSense Metadata*, forcing re-retrieval.
* *Improved Connector Usability*: After you drop an Anypoint Connector on the canvas, no operation is pre-selected, ensuring the configuration steps are more clear.
* *XSD Filtering for Anypoint DataMapper*: It is now possible to map from and to partial XML schemas by filtering elements to be mapped. This allows you to work with large XML structures more easily and makes it possible to import large structures that could not be imported before.

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, Anypoint Studio July 2014 with 3.5.1 Runtime does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by Anypoint Studio May 2014 with 3.5.0 Runtime. MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4 GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM. Please contact MuleSoft with any questions you may have about system requirements.

== Deprecated in this Release

Mflow files have been deprecated. These files were used by Studio in design time. Now you can only use the common Mule configuration XML files.  


== Important Notes and Known Issues in this Release

This list covers important known issues with Anypoint Studio with the 3.5.1 Runtime. Please read this list before reporting any issues you may spot.

=== Mule ESB

Note that only those tickets labeled with MULE apply to both the Enterprise and Community versions of the runtime; tickets labeled with EE apply only to the Enterprise version.

|JIRA |Summary
|MULE-7697 |`com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.exceptions.ObjectStoreException` when executing a reference implementation on Windows
|===

=== Anypoint Studio

* In the debugger perspective we fixed an issue around adding the options to create a Mule Template project and provided a new option to create a project from the libraries. You can reset the Perspective to show these two new options in the context menu.
* When adding a JDBC Driver, a `lib` package is created inside `src/main/app`. This is an Eclipse behavior, even if it looks odd. The `lib` folder exists and the `jar` file is added the the Referenced Libraries. +
* The Internal Web Browser doesn't work in Eclipse in Ubuntu. This prevents Ubuntu users from having the Templates repository functionality from Studio.
*  The first time you open a new workspace in Ubuntu, some of the menus are not shown. This seems to be an Eclipse issue with Ubuntu. After resetting Studio everything is shown as expected.
*  Login popup is displayed when trying to deploy to CloudHub. (STUDIO-5292)

== Migration Guide

This section presents configuration considerations you may want to adjust when migrating from a previous version of a Mule runtime, or previous version of Studio. https://www.mulesoft.com/support-and-services/mule-esb-support-license-subscription[Contact MuleSoft Support] if you have a question about a specific migration activity or concern.

To migrate from a previous version of Studio, use *Help > Check for Updates.*

=== Migrating to the Latest Version

*With Anypoint Studio: * To migrate from the May 2014 version of *Anypoint Studio* , you can visit *Help* > *Install New Software* to upgrade to this version.  

If you update Studio from the May 2014 version to the July 2014 version and don't update the APIKit component, you may encounter errors when running an application. Make sure you also update the APIkit extension via the update site.

If you update Studio from the May 2014 version to the July 2014 version  and want to use the latest ESB Runtime 3.5.1, you need to install it manually, since the Studio update doesn't also update to the 3.5.1 runtime. Once you update Studio, go to *Help > Install New Software* and install the 3.5.1 runtime from the Anypoint Studio Update Site.

To migrate from older versions than the May 2014 release of Anypoint Studio, please download and install the current version from link:http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-open-source-esb[ESB Solutions] or the link:http://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[Customer Portal].

If you wish to install a previous runtime or a community runtime, follow the instructions to link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/adding-community-runtime[add additional runtimes] to your new instance of Studio.

*Without Anypoint Studio: * To migrate from a previous version of Mule ESB standalone, download and install Mule ESB from link:http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-open-source-esb[ESB Solutions] or the link:http://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[Customer Portal]. 

=== Importing Projects Built in an Older Version

To import existing projects into the current version, create a new workspace in Anypoint Studio, then import any existing projects into your new workspace.

In this new version of Studio there is an important difference in the file structure of a project: `.mflow` files (and the `/flows` folder they sit in) no longer exist; instead, `.xml` files (that sit in the folder `src/main/app` folder) now contain flow information. As a result, when opening an old workspace after updating to the current version of Studio, users see a pop up dialog instructing to remove the `mflow` files and the `flows` folder. Studio automatically removes the files after the user confirms this.

*Without Anypoint Studio*: In this case,  you must manually delete any `.mflow` files in your existing projects and move the `.xml` files to the new required location in the `src/main/app` folder.

=== Migrating to the Latest Version of Mule Management Console

The current version of MMC requires migration steps that vary according to the version and setup of the MMC you are migrating from. Please either perform a clean install or follow the steps targeted to your current version in the instructions for link:/mule-management-console/v/3.7/upgrading-the-management-console[Upgrading the Management Console].

MMC can now be deployed in two different "flavors", both as a `.war` file or as a `.ear` file. The `.ear` file is necessary for Weblogic servers, which don't support MMC as a `.war`; the `.war` file is recommended for all servers that support it.
