December 9, 2013

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the release of **Mule Studio (December 2013) with CloudHub Mule Runtime (December 2013)**.

Our new version of Studio functions as a single download with two runtimes:

* Mule 3.4.1 Enterprise Runtime - available for deployment on premises and to CloudHub
* CloudHub Mule Runtime (December 2013) - available for deployment to CloudHub

These release notes apply to Mule Studio (December 2013) and the CloudHub Mule Runtime (December 2013). Note that the new features and functionality described here are *_only available for deployment in CloudHub_* using the CloudHub Mule Runtime (December 2013). If you intend to deploy your application to an on-premises production server, use a Mule 3.4.1 runtime when you begin a new project in Mule Studio. 

Further, these release notes offer some detail on the tangentially released APIkit version 1.1. See <<New Features and Functionality>> section below.

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, Mule Studio (December 2013) with CloudHub Mule Runtime (December 2013) does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by Mule 3.4.1. Please https://www.mulesoft.com/support-and-services/mule-esb-support-license-subscription[contact MuleSoft Support] with any questions you may have about system requirements.

== Important Notes and Known Issues in this Release

This list covers some of the known issues with Mule Studio (December 2013) with CloudHub Mule Runtime (December 2013). Please read this list before reporting any issues you may have spotted.

=== API Manager

[cols="2*"]
|===
|HABITAT-1194 a|
Services, proxies, or APIs deployed to the December 2013 release on CloudHub and manually registered in API Manager using the CloudHub endpoint URL do not support runtime policies. For more details, see the link:/release-notes/api-manager-release-notes[API Manager release notes].

Workaround:

This issue is fixed in the updated API Manager agent version 5.0.1, which is embedded in the Mule 3.4.2 runtime. As a workaround, deploy services, APIs, and proxies to the Mule 3.4.2 runtime on CloudHub.

== Migrating from Mule Studio October 2013 to Mule Studio December 2013

[NOTE]
It is recommended that you create a **new workspace in Mule Studio (December 2013)**, then import any existing projects into your new workspace.

[%autowidth.spread]
|======
|MULE-7013 |The `keepSendSocketOpen` attribute in the HTTP/S connector is deprecated. It is inherited from TCP Connector but has no effect on outbound HTTP connections and will be removed in the future.
|MULE-7023 |The `keep-alive` attribute in inbound and outbound HTTP/S endpoints has been renamed to `keepAlive`.
|MULE-7011 |The *`org.mule.util.queue.Queue`* class now has a `clear()` method to discard all elements in the queue while leaving the queue usable. If you have your own implementation of a Mule Queue, be sure to to implement the new method.
|MULE-7010 |The `ObjectStore` class now has a `clear()` method which discards all elements while leaving the store usable. If you have your own implementation of ObjectStore, be sure to implement the new method.
|MULE-7090 |Mule uses the default security provider and TLSv1 as the default algorithm for secure socket connections. The +
 *`tlsProtocolHandler`* attribute from the TLS configuration in SSL, TLS, SMTPS, and Jetty HTTPS transports is deprecated. Mule uses the default settings defined in the JVM platform. This parameter is no longer needed in +
 supported JDKs.
|MULE-6968 |Previously, requests to "`/`" were only received by an *HTTP endpoint* when no path was defined, and rejected if path was empty or set to "`/`". Now requests are received by the endpoint in any of the three cases.
|MULE-7061 |The Jetty transport now uses *Jetty 8*. Applications using a custom `jetty.xml` configuration file must update the Jetty classes referenced in this file. Review http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Starting/Porting_to_Jetty_7/Packages_and_Classes[details] for more information.
