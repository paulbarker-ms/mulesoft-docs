See link:/release-notes/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes].


== Migration Guide

XML entity expansion in XML transformers is now disabled by default because it allows DoS attacks. To restore previous behavior use the expandInternalEntities="true" attribute.

XML entity expansion in Jersey is now disabled by default because it allows DoS attacks. To restore previous behavior use the mule.xml.expandInternalEntities=true property.

Processing after a `synchronous until successful` resulting in a `VoidMuleEvent` will now continue with the original event.
