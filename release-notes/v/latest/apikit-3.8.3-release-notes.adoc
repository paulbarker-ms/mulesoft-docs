= APIkit 3.8.3 Release Notes
:keywords: apikit, 3.8.3, release notes

APIkit 3.8.3 solves the problem that occurs when a load balancer or reverse proxy is configured in front of an APIkit application. By default the console uses the URL as defined in the listener or the URL provided by CloudHub. When you need a different URL, configure the keepRamlBaseUri attribute. When enabled, APIkit uses the RAML baseUri unmodified. This attribute is false by default. If the RAML Base URI is relative, APIkit now uses the relative URI without overwriting it. 

When you send a request that includes a query parameter without `=` to an APIkit 3.8.3 app, the value of the query parameter is null. For example, in http://localhost:8080/resource?queryParameter the value of queryParameter is null. Consequently, only query parameters of type `nil` pass APIkit validation; query parameters of any other type fail.

This release also fixes bugs listed in "<<Fixed in this Release>>", most notably:

* A stack overflow error that occurs when you send a large number of URI parameters
* Java parser fixes for RAML 0.8 and 1.0, including custom facets access through the API and support for question mark syntactic sugar in custom facets and parameters.

== Compatibility

* Mule Runtime 3.8.x
* Anypoint Studio 6.2.0
* Java Parser RAML 1.0 and 1.0.3
* Java Parser RAML 0.8 and 0.8.17
* Console 3.0.10

== Known Issues

The fix for the problem that occurs when a load balancer or reverse proxy is configured in front of an APIkit application does not solve the problem of accessing the application from different domains. This problem cannot be solved with relative paths. The issue CONSOLE-176 is addressing this problem.

== Fixed in this Release

This release fixes the following APIkit and RAML Java parser issues.

*APIkit Issues*

* APIKIT-545  New property: keepRamlBaseUri
* APIKIT-570  Optional fields using ? flag in RAML are parsed as mandatory fields ending in ?
* APIKIT-584  Duplicated query parameters are considered valid
* APIKIT-610  Flow with XML as response is not generated correctly.
* APIKIT-651  StackOverflowError when there is a huge list of uri parameters
