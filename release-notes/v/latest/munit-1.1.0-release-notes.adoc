*September 17, 2015*

We are happy to announce the new release of MUnit version 1.1.0. In this release we’ve introduced new coverage capabilities, improved our Studio integration, and added a number of enhancements and fixes to make testing easier.

== Hardware and Software Requirements

* Microsoft Windows 8 +
* Apple Mac OS X 10.10 +
* Linux (tested on Ubuntu 15)
* Java 7, Java 8
* Maven 3.1+

== Compatibility

* Mule 3.6.x or 3.7.x
* Anypoint Studio 5.4.0 +

== Features and Functionality

=== Presenting MUnit Coverage

For some time now users were able to see basic coverage in the Anypoint Studio UI. With this release (1.1.0), users can generate complete coverage reports in a continuous integration system through the MUnit Maven Plugin. These reports  allow you to check the coverage your application in detail and see coverage at the application, flow and message processor level. A build fails if the coverage metrics you’ve defined for your application are not met.

=== Anypoint Studio Integration

Starting with this release of Anypoint Studio, MUnit ships with Anypoint Studio. That means that you get MUnit without needing to installing it before hand, which creates a cleaner user experience.

In addition to the Anypoint Studio integration we have fixed/enhanced a few features:

* Improved MUnit icons to better integrate with Studio design rules
* Improved look & feel of the ignore test feature
* You can now define the debug port when debugging a MUnit test
* Improved MUnit classpath configuration

=== MUnit Runtime

We have also improved the core of MUnit as well as the MUnit Maven Plugin:
* There is a new MEL function to return the same payload in a mock
* Added support for mime type/encoding (in mocks and set MP)
* Improved runtime errors
* New exception strategies
* Improved logs in case of a failure

And for users using the MUnit Maven Plugin, in addition to the coverage feature we have added two more features:

* Dynamic ports assignment which allows you to avoid port collision in CI environments
* Added a new property to skip MUnit tests only and still run all your other tests
