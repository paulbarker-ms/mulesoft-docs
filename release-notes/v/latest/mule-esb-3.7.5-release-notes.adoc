== Migration Guidance

This section lists issues that can affect migration to Mule 3.7.5. Also, see link:/release-notes/updating-mule-versions[these general guidelines].

=== MULE-10306

XML entity expansion in XML transformers is now disabled by default because it allows DoS attacks. To restore previous behavior use the `expandInternalEntities="true"` attribute.

=== MULE-10686

XML entity expansion in Jersey is now disabled by default because it allows DoS attacks. To restore previous behavior use the `mule.xml.expandInternalEntities=true` property.

=== MULE-10979

The default response timeout and default transaction timeout can't be configured using system properties on the command line or in the wrapper.conf file anymore. Instead, use the configuration element. For example:

`<configuration defaultResponseTimeout="20000"  defaultTransactionTimeout="40000"/>`

=== MULE-11118

The HTTP listener now replies with status code 503 when the thread pool is exhausted (and `poolExhaustedAction="ABORT"`) instead of closing the socket.
