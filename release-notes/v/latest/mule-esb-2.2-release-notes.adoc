== New Management Console

The management console for Mule ESB is built on the new Hyperic HQ 4.1.2 platform, which includes many new features since 3.5.0. The management console also includes support for Mule embedded in WebSphere and JBoss, whereas Mule HQ only supports monitoring standalone Mule instances.

The management console supports Mule ESB 2.x. It does not include support for profiling or patch management, so if you need those features, or if you need to support Mule 1.x, use Mule HQ 3.5.0 instead.

== Known Issues

This section describes the known issues in this release and how to work around each issue.

* If you are experiencing agent-server communication problems with Mule HQ or the Mule management console, upgrade to JRE 1.5 or 1.6 by setting the environment variable HQ_JAVA_HOME for the MuleHQ agent and server.
* In Mule HQ and the Mule management console, if a configuration file cannot be found or the wrong user ID or password are used to access JMX, the error message simply says "Mule Enterprise Edition is already running."
* In the Mule management console, you must run `agent.bat install` before you run `agent.bat start`. The message that appears after you install does not tell you to run `agent.bat install`, but it is documented in the steps in the user guide.
* JCA deployment works for embedding Mule in JBoss 4.2 only and not 5.1.

== Fixed Issues

Mule Enterprise 2.2 includes many new features and fixes developed on Mule Community Edition. For a list of these fixes, see link:/release-notes/legacy-mule-release-notes[Mule 2 Release Notes].
