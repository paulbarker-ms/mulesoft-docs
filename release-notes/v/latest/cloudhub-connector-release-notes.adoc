The CloudHub connector provides the ability to interact with CloudHub from within a Mule application. The operations allow you to deploy, start, stop, and update applications as well as send notifications from your Mule application to CloudHub.


=== Upgrading to the Latest Version

When a new version of a connector is released, Anypoint Studio displays a popup in the bottom right corner of you screen with the following message: Updates Available.

To upgrade to version 2.0 of the CloudHub connector:

. Click the popup and check for the available updates.
. Select the CloudHub Connector version checkbox and click Next.
. Follow the instructions provided by the user interface.
. Restart Studio when prompted.
. After restarting, if you have several versions of the connector installed, Mule asks you for the version of the connector you like to use.

** Create And Deploy Application: Creates and deploys a Mule application.
** Change Notification Status: Changes the status (Read or Unread) of a notification.
** Change Application Status: Changes the status (Start or Stop) of an application.
** Get Notification: Retrieves a notification by their ID.
** Retrieve Application Log: Retrieves the log from an application.
* CloudHub connector as a Source: Added the operation to poll for notifications.
* Deleted the following processors:
** Start application: Migrated to Change Application Status processor.
** Stop application: Migrated to Change Application Status processor.
** Dismiss notification: Migrated to Change Notification Status.
* Modified the following processors:
** Create notification: Now the domain needs to be provided. To have the same behavior for CloudHub instances, use `${domain}` place holder.
** Create tenant: Now the Tenant configuration can only be filled by reference.
** Deploy application: Now only deploys application, and cannot modify anymore CloudHub configuration. To modify a CloudHub configuration, use Update Application.
** List notifications: Now the domain needs to be provided. To have the same behavior for CloudHub instances, use the `${domain}` place holder.
** List tenants: Now the Tenant configuration can only be filled by reference.
** Update application: Modified to comply with the existing CloudHub API.

=== Known Issues

The use of application Domain has become mandatory in many operations. This breaks backward compatibility with older applications. This is due to a CloudHub requirement and cannot be removed.
