=== Fixed Issues

* Significantly reduced the amount of classes that were being exported with the update sites, thus reducing the file size from 500mb to 5mb
* Fixed an issue where Mule applications were running out of memory when using the HCM connector.

=== Features in this Release

Users are now able to choose specifically which modules of the HCM connector they would like to install in Anypoint Studio, and use in their Mule applications.

=== Upgrading from Workday HCM Connector 4.0.1 or Older

In this release, each of the above modules is now available as an individual update site. Note that this release is NOT backward compatible with Workday HCM Connector 4.0.1 or lower.

If you would like to start using of the Workday connector, follow these instructions.

==== New Users

. Open Anypoint Studio.
. Go to *File* > *New* > *Project From Template*.
. Click the *Connectors* category and locate the Workday Connector from the connectors list.
. Click the *View Details* button.
. Click the *Share URL* button and copy the provided link.
. Go to *Help* > *Install New Software* and paste the link inside the *Work with* text box.
. Select the desired Workday module and click the *Next* button to continue installing the connector.

==== Existing Users

There are several ways to determine which HCM module you were using in the previous versions of the connector. One way is to check the XML namespaces for the Workday message processors. This table helps you determine which modules your application uses:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Namespace |Workday Module
|wd:absence |Absence Management
|wd:benefits |Benefits Administration
|wd:compensation |Compensation
|wd:hr |Human Resources
|wd:payroll |Payroll
|wd:payroll-interface |Payroll Interface
|wd:performance |Performance Management
|wd:recruiting |Recruiting
|wd:staffing |Staffing
|wd:talent |Talent
|wd:timetracking |Time Tracking
|wd:workforce |Workforce Planning
|===

===== Non-Maven Mule Projects

. Uninstall any existing Workday connector.
. Install the Workday connectors that your application requires from the `Anypoint Connectors Update Site`. Follow the instructions in the "New users" section. Your application should be running as it was previously.

===== Mavenized Mule Projects

. Remove any references to the Workday connector from your pom.xml file. 
. Update the mule-maven-plugin, if it exists, by modifying the artifactId property that is located inside the _inclusion_ tag as follows:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Module |Artifact ID
|*Absence Management* |mule-module-workday-absencemanagement
|*Benefits Administration* |mule-module-workday-benefitsadministration
|*Compensation* |mule-module-workday-compensation
|*Human Resources* |mule-module-workday-humanresources
|*Payroll* |mule-module-workday-payroll
|*Payroll Interface* |mule-module-workday-payrollinterface
|*Performance Management* |mule-module-workday-performancemanagement

|*Talent* |mule-module-workday-talent
|*Time Tracking* |mule-module-workday-timetracking
|*Workforce Planning* |mule-module-workday-workforceplanning

+
. Add any dependencies that your application needs for each Workday module. The following dependency snippets can be used to add the necessary Workday HCM connectors.
