== New Features

* Support for external libraries: Externally required JARs dependencies can now be defined as a required runtime dependency. This forces a user to install them before executing a connector. For more information, see
link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7/creating-a-java-sdk-based-connector#adding-native-libraries-and-jars-to-a-connector-build[Adding Native Libraries and JARs to a Connector Build].
* Long text configuration: The inclusion of @Text annotation enables the configuration of long multi-line configurations on global elements.
* Improve Connector Site Generation: Site generation has been revamped including not just the API documentation but also on demo projects and multiple versions.
* Support for Select connector category: This extends the previously supported categories of Community, Standard, and Premium. You can view Select category connectors in https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?type=connector[Anypoint Exchange].
* Cleaned up WARNINGS during compilation: Several improvements has been included to remove confusing WARNING reports during connector compilation.
* Functional Interop Error Report: Several improvements have been added for when an error is reported by adding more details about it.



== Known Issues

DevKit 3.6.1 is fully compatible with DevKit 3.6.0; however, new functional test practices are now enforced in the data definition. TestRunMessage maps where a beanId doesn't follow the `<operationName>TestData` convention are placed in the MuleEvent payload at flow invocation instead of having their keys turned into flowVars.
