== Feature Highlights

=== New in MMC

* Email Alert destination UI. Makes it easier to configure destinations to escalate alerts via email
* SNMP Alert destination UI. Makes it easier to configure destinations to escalate alerts via SNMP traps (supports both SNMP v2 and v3)
* Mule instances Auto Discovery. Simplifies connecting the management console to Mule server instances.
* Mule HA (high availability) support
* External LDAP configuration
* Performance improvements

=== New in Mule

* Improvements to exception handling: Until now, Mule exceptions could be handled more than once by the exception strategies. Exception strategies will now be executed once for a given exception. If you are relying upon multiple exception strategies being called for a particular exception, you need to adapt your code.
* Now supports Tanuki wrapper 4.3.0
* Inbound client connections now supported for TCP transport
* File connector now able to listen on subdirectories
* JDBC Query timeouts now supported
* HTTP transport now supports redirects
* New WMQ connector attribute: clientID
* MessagePropertiesTransformer enhanced to support expressions and wildcards
* MessagePropertiesTransformer can now remove many message properties at once (either by wildcards or regex)

== Supported Platforms and Deployments

Mule ESB Management Console has been tested with and supports the following platforms:

== Known Issues

=== ESB Issues

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Key |Summary
|MULE-4771 |Stockquote WSDL example fails with exception. Workaround: Add %JAVA_HOME%\bin to the path
|EE-1257 |Mule cannot "see" the license when there is a space in MULE_HOME (e.g., "Program Files"). Workaround: MULE_HOME must not have a space in it (e.g. "Program Files").
|EE-1735 |Maven archetypes (project, transport, module etc.) fail because the required artifacts are not available. Workaround: Continue to use the 2.2.1 archetypes.
|EE-2008 |Jdbc example not able to process CSV file for insert data into the database. The fix is to add a ObjectToString transformer before the CsvToMapTransformer in the file inbound endpoint.
