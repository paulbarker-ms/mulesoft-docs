The Anypoint Connector for the Mule Object Store enables the manipulation of object stores within Mule. This connector provides access to default in-memory, custom, and persistent object stores.

== Compatibility

The Object Store connector is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|3.6.x and later
|ObjectStore|2013
|Java|1.7.0_x
|Anypoint Studio|5.x and later
|===

== 2.2.0

*June 8, 2018*

*Warning:* This version behaves differently than previous versions when dealing with object store references and partitions. Previously, when setting an object store reference, the `partition` name parameter was ignored. It is now used, and the connector tries to create that partition and use it. 

This change means that:

* If you define an objectstore-ref and the object store is partitionable, the connector uses the partition name.
* If you define an objectstore-ref and the object store is NOT partitionable, the connector ignores the partition name.
* If you don't define an objectstore-ref, but supply a partition name, the connector applies the partition name to the default object store.

=== Fixed in this Release

* *`Dispose Store` operation on CloudHub* - The *Dispose Store* operation would not work under CloudHub with Object Store v2. This has been fixed.
* *Partitionable stores* - Previously, the `partition` parameter was ignored when the user provided an Object Store reference. This was changed, and the connector will attempt to create the partition in the given Object Store instance, if it is partitionable.

=== Known Issues

* *`_defaultUserObjectStore` in standalone runtime* - It does not allow creating partitions. If you set it as an `objectstore-ref`, make sure not to set a partition name.

== 2.1.1

*March 2, 2018*

=== Fixed in this Release

* *ClassCastException when target property is defined* - The retrieve method used to fail with a ClassCastException when a "target" property was defined and the payload sent to the connector was non-serializable. This is no longer the case.


== 2.1.0 

*February 3, 2017*

* New operation: *Dispose store*: Removes an object store partition. Before, the only way to remove an object store partition was by calling the `disposePartition` function of the `ObjectStoreManager` inside a Java custom component.

==  2.0.1

*June 21, 2016*

=== Fixes

* When using a persistent object store, all entries were getting deleted, in error, at shutdown and re-deployment.

== 2.0.0

*May 18, 2016*

* All processors are executed inside a lock, thus providing consistency and avoiding data loss or corruption when working with transactions or concurrency, for example.

=== Fixes

* Processor *retrieveWithLock* was removed as a consequence of the lock implementation described above.

== 1.3.3

*August 3, 2015*

_Community_

=== Features

Added two new operations: `retrieveWithLock` and `retrieveStore`.

=== Fixes

* Previously, the retrieve operation did not modify the payload when the target property was set. This has been fixed.
* Fixed an error that caused the connector to not validate its global parameters.
