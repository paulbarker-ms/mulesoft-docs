=== Fixed In This Release

As part of the update of the MSMQ Connector and Windows Gateway Services, the following issues are fixed in 1.4 release of the MSMQ Connector:

* If a queue name was not specified at the global element level, an error message would be reported repeatedly stating `org.mule.modules.msmq.MsmqException: Queue not found:"null"` even if the connector instance defined a queue name that overrode this global queue setting. The queue connectivity test is no longer run if the global element does not specify a queue name to use.

* In Studio 5.0.2 and ESB 3.6, an error was reported with Test Connection stating that the test failed due to `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sun/jersey/api/client/config/ClientConfig. `This was caused by a Jersey version in the connector being out of sync with Studio and ESB server.

* If a Mule app was hot-redeployed in Studio or ESB Server, the MSMQ connector would report an error stating that ` Receiving Thread ERROR org.mule.modules.msmq.MsmqConnector - Error while trying to process response. Cannot process event as "applicationName" is stopped (org.mule.api.lifecycle.LifecycleException).` This was caused by the stop callback never being invoked.

[IMPORTANT]
This release requires an upgrade to version 1.4 of the Anypoint Gateway Service for Windows. For more information, see the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/windows-gateway-services-guide[Windows Gateway Services Guide].

=== Bug Fixes

Remote-queue reliable messaging support: Fixes a bug that prevented the successful dequeue of messages from a remote queue due to an interaction with the reliable-messaging features using sub-queues.

=== Features

The MSMQ Connector now supports: 

*  *Message exception management*: Errors occurring during the process of sending or receiving queued messages now always raise an exception directly in the flow. This allows the built-in logging and error routing support within Mule to leverage automatically. Where no exception management strategy is defined, messages are returned to the dead-letter-queue as specified in the instance config, or the system dead-letter-queue of the machine where the target queue lives.
*  *Exactly-once in-order support:* When the `message-processing-strategy` of a flow is set to synchronous, messages that are processed from MSMQ queues are guaranteed to be presented to the flow in exactly the order that they were sent, and to be received once and only once.

*  *CloudHub support*: The MSMQ connector now has to be certified for use on CloudHub. You can deploy your Mule application to CloudHub. Ensure that the connector configuration points to the Anypoint Gateway Windows Service running on-premises. The Anypoint Gateway Windows Service provides the interface into the MSMQ infrastructure in your enterprise, so it must be installed and verified as working prior to deploying.

*  *Message timeouts*: You can now set the number of seconds for the *timeToBeReceived* and *timeToReachQueue* property settings. When either of these timeouts occur, messages are moved to a dead-letter-queue that exists as a sub-queue of the origin. You can customize the location of the dead letter queue using the instance properties of the connector. Both properties default to zero (0), which indicates that the property never times out.

*  *Message acknowledgement*: Messages that are not normally MSMQ messages are now surfaced in the flow, allowing an alternative sub-flow to handle conditions such as correlation on ACK or retry on NACK. These messages can be identified by the message properties. You can set a Choice control flow shape using custom recovery or journaling logic. 
*  *Zero-message-loss to bus*: When using transactional queues, the MSMQ connector now guarantees zero-message-loss while the message is delivered to the bus. Only after the message is successfully received by Mule can it be removed from the origin queue. Users don’t need to perform additional configuration other than selecting an MSMQ queue that is marked as transactional. Mule manages a reliable dequeue behind the scenes.
