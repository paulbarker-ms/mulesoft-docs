[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.
