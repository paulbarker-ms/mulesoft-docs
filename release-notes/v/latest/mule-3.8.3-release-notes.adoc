= Mule Runtime 3.8.3 Release Notes
:keywords: mule, 3.8.3, runtime, release notes

*December 2, 2016*

Mule Runtime 3.8.3 includes enhancements, an important change affecting default policy polling time, bug fixes, and a library change.

Mule Runtime 3.8.3 key enhancements are:

* Support for Mule link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/application-deployment#deploying-applications-in-parallel[parallel application deployment]
+
Deploying applications in parallel reduces the startup time when you deploy a large number.
* Availability of the link:/api-manager/gatekeeper[gatekeeper feature] on clusters
+
APIs on a cluster are blocked and return a 503 status code until a complete reconciliation cycle with API Manager occurs. Policies declared as applied on the UI are applied. Policies unapplied since the last restart are removed.
+
* Refactored throttling algorithm
+
Functionality, scalability, and performance are improved by algorithm changes. Throttling headers work correctly on a cluster. A counter persistent state has been added to standalone and cluster deployments.
+
* Response time
+
Policies are now applied to an API version as soon as retrieved instead of waiting for all policies to be fetched. Policies are now cached to avoid unnecessary processing.
+
* COBOL Copybook bug fixes and support for DEPENDING ON clauses. This feature is now GA.
+
* Support for larger than memory XML payloads (up to 2 GB)

*Important change*:

The default policy polling time has been extended to reduce the load on API Manager and improve scalability. MuleSoft based this change on careful examination of actual customer experiences. A minimum 60-second delay now occurs between the time you apply a policy in the UI and the time the policy actually goes into effect. The same delay occurs when you disable or edit a policy. You can link:/api-manager/using-policies#configuring-the-policy-polling-time[configure the length of the delay].

The unified Mule Runtime 3.8.3 and API Gateway is compatible with APIkit 3.8.3.


== Bundled Runtime Manager Agent

This version of Mule runtime comes bundled with the Runtime Manager Agent plugin version 1.6.0.

See link:/release-notes/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes].

== DataWeave Language Improvements

* Added support for default namespaces on XML parser
* Cached the result of the property access function
* Removed the reader property `encoding`
+
The reader property `encoding` is not available as of version 3.8.3. Apps created in earlier versions that use the property should be modified so that the source of the message data sets the correct character encoding.
