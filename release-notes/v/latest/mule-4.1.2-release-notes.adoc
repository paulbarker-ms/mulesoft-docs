|Issue |Description
| MULE-14958 | For the WorkDay connector, the datasense is coming back with @type instead of ns0:type  - this is on the get_workers operation and type is part of the ns0#ID reference.
| MULE-14897 | Transformation service changes Map<K, List<V>> to a MultiMap
| MULE-14781 | DW does not require a Java class to be exported in order to be invoked
| MULE-14725 | Non blocking operations use connector's thread to do internal mule processing

== Upgrade Requirements

[%header,cols="15a,85a"]
|===
|Issue |Description
| MULE-14910 | logged event ID will not be formatted anymore. Replace "%X{correlationId}" by "[event: %X{correlationId}]" in log config files to keep behavior.
| MULE-14962 | increased default value for fixed-frequency component to 1 minute. Add 'frequency="1000"' to keep behavior (e.g. '<fixed-frequency frequency="1000"/>').

=== Fixed Issues

In this patch version, a critical issue when using OpenID connect policy applied to a HTTP Mule Proxy is fixed (when a valid access token was provided, a 500 HTTP status code was returned because of a runtime Exception triggered after successful validation of said token).
