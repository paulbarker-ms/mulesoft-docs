= Mule Runtime 3.8.0-M1 Release Notes
:keywords: mule, 3.8.0-M1, release notes


MuleSoft is pleased to announce the milestone M1 release of the Mule 3.8.0, containing many exciting improvements:

* This release unifies the link:/api-manager/api-gateway-runtime-archive[API Gateway runtime] with the core Mule runtime, simplifying development and operations. Please see the link:/release-notes/api-gateway-runtime-to-mule-3.8.0-migration-guide[migration guide] for information on how to migrate.
* Improved troubleshooting messages, so that you can see the location of any errors in the flow and you receive better error messages for common problems.

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/tls-configuration[TLS Improvements]: TLS context can be shared in a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/shared-resources[domain], the cipher suite and protocol configuration is allowed at a connector level. TLS 1.0 is now disabled by default and there is a new "insecure" mode for local testing which doesn't perform certificate validation.
* Includes the new link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave[DataWeave] release, which contains support for flat files and performance improvements.
* New functionality for configuring the use of link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/creating-and-managing-a-cluster-manually[clusters]. This Includes:
** a 'quorum' parameter that determines the minimum number of servers that should be active for flows to be executed
** JDBC object store improvements
** Possibility to monitor the cluster members via the JMX protocol.
* Additional tuning parameters for batch processing


*January 26, 2016*

== Migration Guide

When migrating from an API Gateway Runtime, follow this link:/release-notes/api-gateway-runtime-to-mule-3.8.0-migration-guide[migration guide].

* MULE-9183: Status code for successful one-way operations handled through CXF will be 202 instead of 200
* MULE-9041: The HTTP Connector will leave the inbound property http.remote.address with the actual remote address. If an X-Forwarded-For header is present, it will be available as an inbound property.
* MULE-9020: BouncyCastle was upgraded to version 1.50.
Notes:
DESede algorithm now requires keys of 16 or 24 bytes unlike the prior version which required 16 or 22 bytes.
bcmail (Bouncy Castle S/MIME API) dependency was removed. If you need any of its functionalities, you must add the library by yourself."
* MULE-8963: Exceptions that extend org.mule.api.MessagingException now receive the org.mule.api.processor.MessageProcessor that was executing in the constructor.
* MULE-8927: The attributes that end in an endpoint URI (for instance: smtp user and passwords) had to be encoded as a workaround for this issue. That workaround now has to be removed. Notes:
This also affects the result of MEL expressions (for instance, if an expression evaluated to a username with an @ char, it had to be encoded before using it), so a check has to be done to remove all the additional encoding that was placed for working this around.
* MULE-8626: The HTTP Connector will now ignore a "Connection" outbound property when responding to a request (listener) or making one (request), instead of transforming it to a header. This means that: if such property is desired, it should be explicitly added as a header using a response/request builder.
* MULE-8678: The HTTP Connector will now ignore a "Host" outbound property when making a request, instead of transforming it to a header. This means that: if such property is desired, it should be explicitly added as a header using a request builder.
* MULE-8676: The HTTP Connector will now ignore a "Transfer-Encoding" outbound property when sending a response, instead of transforming it to a header. This means that: if such property is desired, it should be explicitly added as a header using a response builder.
* MULE-8677: The HTTP Connector will now ignore a "Transfer-Encoding" outbound property when making a request, instead of transforming it to a header. This means that: if such property is desired, it should be explicitly added as a header using a request builder.
* EE-4637: Batch history expiration is no longer configured through system properties but through the new <batch:history> element
* MULE-8844: When until-successful throws an exception, it will now be a RetryPolicyExhaustedException wrapping the cause of the exception of the last try, instead of a MessagingException wrapping a RetryPolicyExhaustedException with no link to the actual cause.
* MULE-9044: The HTTP Listener will now return a 400 instead of a 500 when an invalid Content-Type is sent on a request. Additionally, in both cases a response body will be present.
* MULE-6298: AbstractMessageSequenceSplitter#process will now return null instead of a VoidMuleEvent. This affects only the scenario where the elements of a split collection are filtered out.


== Library Changes

* MULE-9318	Update joda-time to version 2.9 or newer
