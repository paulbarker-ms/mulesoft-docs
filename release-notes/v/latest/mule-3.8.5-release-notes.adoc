= Mule Runtime 3.8.5 Release Notes
:keywords: mule, 3.8.5, runtime, release notes

*June 30, 2017*

// In Aug/Sept release, mention AGW-1217 supports client OpenID Connect token enforcement.

Mule Runtime 3.8.5 includes the following enhancements, changes, and fixes:

* DataWeave (SE) and API Gateway (AGW) enhancements
* Fixes to HTTP request streaming
* Issues resolved in Mule Runtime Enterprise Edition (EE), Mule Runtime (MULE), DataWeave, and API Gateway
* Mule Runtime library changes

This release is supported on Anypoint Private Cloud Edition 1.6.1 and later.

== Key Enhancements

Key enhancements are:

* Improvements in the communication with the Platform by implementing a backoff logic in the event of failed requests. A failure in the connection triggers incremental reconnection times up to a maximum of 15 minutes.
* Several fixes related to resource level policies and cluster scenarios.
* A security enhancement to the OAuth token enforcement and PingFederate token enforcement policies to ensure that the client that was granted the access token has access to the API. 
* Introducing Open ID Connect support. If the organization is suitably configured, you may leverage the out-of-the-box oAuth token enforcement policy based on Open ID Connect.

////
+
When you don't want to validate the client id, you can download the following custom policies, which are based on the original policies. These policies do not include the client validation step:
+
** OpenAM OAuth Token Enforcement zip file (xml and yaml)...Exchange link TBD
** PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement zip file (xml and yaml)...Exchange link TBD

== Changes

*HTTP Streaming*

HTTP request streaming of responses is added to this release. Since you might not be consuming response streams in your existing apps, this addition is disabled by default. Set the following system properties to override this default for all HTTP requests in a container:

* Enable streaming: `mule.http.streamResponse` = true
* Response buffer size:  `mule.http.responseBufferSize` = NUMBER_OF_BYTES

For information about how to set system properties, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/configuring-properties#system-properties[Configuring Properties, System Properties].

*Flat File Processing in DataWeave*

When a DataWeave transformation outputs in Flat File, Fixed Width or Cobol Copybook format, one of the writer properties behaves differently. The property `recordTerminator` now defines what is placed as a termination for every record, in previous releases this is only used as a separator when there are multiple records. If you don't want this value to appear when writing single records, you must set the `recordTerminator` property to `none`.



== Software Compatibility Testing

Mule was tested on the following software:

== Issues Impacting Migration

[%header,cols="15a,85a"]
|===
|Issue |Description
| MULE-12017 | log4j was updated from 2.5 to 2.8.2 and slf4j from 1.7.7 to 1.7.24. There is a minor incompatibility with code using `logger.error(null, "message", e)`, in which case the first null argument should be omitted.
| MULE-12147 | Added proxy support to the SFTP connector through system properties: `mule.sftp.proxy.host`, `mule.sftp.proxy.port`, `mule.sftp.proxy.protocol` (can be `HTTP`, `SOCKS4` or `SOCKS5`), `mule.sftp.proxy.username` (if required), `mule.sftp.proxy.password` (if required)
| MULE-12612 | As FTP reconnection is at operation level, FTP connector does not support asynchronous reconnection strategies because it only makes sense if reconnection takes place during the start phase of the connector lifecycle. In case you use this kind of reconnection, change reconnections as follows: <reconnect blocking="true"/> inside FTP Connector, or just remove the blocking attribute.
