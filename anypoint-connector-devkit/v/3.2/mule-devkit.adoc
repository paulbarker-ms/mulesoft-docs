= Mule DevKit

The web has introduced thousands of new applications for business, IT, collaboration, social media, e-commerce and productivity and many of them now expose web APIs to integrate and automate the use of these applications and the data they manage.

Mule Runtime supports a growing number of Cloud Connectors but you or your customers might require connectivity to a application API which is not currently listed. To help with this, there is the Mule DevKit which guides the developer though the setup and creation of a Cloud Connector.

In addition to creating connectors, the DevKit can help you build transformers, filters, transports, and much... much more.
