= Mule DevKit

The Web has introduced thousands of new applications for business, IT, collaboration, social media, e-commerce and productivity. Many Web apps expose web APIs to integrate and automate the use of these applications and the data they manage.

Mule includes many connectors that make it easy to connect a Mule application to an external APIs. However, you might require connectivity to an application API that is not currently in Mule's arsenal. Therefore, we introduced the *Mule DevKit* to enable developers to build their own connectors.

In addition to creating connectors, the DevKit can help you build transformers, filters, transports, and much more.
