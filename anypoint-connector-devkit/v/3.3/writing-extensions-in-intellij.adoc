= Writing Extensions in IntelliJ

IntelliJ includes out of the box Maven support therefore it doesn't require for you to download any extra plugins.

[WARNING]
This guide was built using IntelliJ X but earlier or later versions should work as well

== Importing the project

. After you have generated your project with our Maven archetype, choose *File -> New Project* and select *Import project from an external resource*

. Now, click Finish. Your IDE should start importing your Maven dependencies.

== Resolving the schema

Now, you need to instruct your IDE to help it find you newly generated schema so you get all the benefits from auto complete and validation.

. Open the namespace handler xml that was generated for you by the archetype. You should see something along the lines of this:
