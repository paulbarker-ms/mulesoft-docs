Perceptive Flow Design is an Anypoint Studio functionality that facilitates mapping of data from one data format and structure to another. +
If you model a flow to include an Anypoint Connector with a working configuration selected, preceded or followed by a Transform Message component, Mule uses the working connection to the resource to retrieve metadata about message payload and properties. Capturing the data type and structure of the connected resource, Mule feeds that data into DataWeave, providing the expected input or output, avoiding you the trouble to manually inspect the message structure your self.

For example, imagine that you need to connect your organization's Salesforce accounts with Twitter to publicize specific performance indicators. +
By dropping two connectors on your Studio canvas – Salesforce and Twitter – and configure them to connect to your organization's accounts, you can then drop a Transform Message component between the connectors and inspect its Mule Properties View to find that Mule has intelligently captured the data type and structure information from each SaaS provider, and prescribed the input and output for your data mapping. With the prescription in place, all you need to do is configure the mapping, filling in the blanks of the DataWeave code.

Now imagine you are obtaining status update data from a Twitter connector and that you want to log the tweet text but you aren't familiar with the property names used by this connector. Instead of having to look up Twitter's documentation to find out the name of the property you need, you can just place a Logger message processor right after the Twitter connector and write in it. If you start writing *`#[payload.`* in the logger's Message field, and then press **ctrl + space bar**, you will get a list of all the properties and methods associated to the payload, including the properties returned by the request that you're performing on the Twitter connector.
