= About Anypoint Studio

Anypoint Studio is MuleSoft's Eclipse-based integration development environment for designing and testing Mule applications.

Anypoint Studio offers plenty of features that enhance your productivity when building Mule applications:

* Instant run of your Mule application inside a local runtime.
* Visual editors to configure API definition files and Mule domains.
* Push changes to a local running app to test changes.
* Integration with Exchange to import templates, examples, definitions and other resources from your Anypoint Platform organization.
* Embedded unit testing framework.
* Built-in support to deploy to CloudHub.

Anypoint Studio 7.x only supports Mule 4.x projects since the structure of the project, export format, xml and scripting language are different. +
It is not possible to embedded Mule 3.x runtimes or older versions into Anypoint Studio 7.x

== Editors

Anypoint Studio offers Editors, a visual component used to design and edit a resource. They allow you to edit:

* Mule configuration files.
* API definitions.
* Properties files.
* A pom.xml file to handle dependencies.

The Mule Config File Editor is the main editor in Anypoint Studio. +
It contains three tabs which offer different ways to interface with your application:

* The Message Flow tab.
+

+
Contains the canvas in which you can see a visual representation of your flows. You can drag and drop Event Processors from the Mule Palette into the canvas to add them to your flow. +
Clicking an Event Processor in the canvas opens up the Mule Properties View with the attributes for the selected processor, allowing you to edit them.

* The Global Elements tab.
+

In this tab you can create, edit or delete configuration files.

* The Configuration XML tab.

Contains the XML of your Mule Application. +
All changes that you apply here is reflected in the canvas and the Properties View of your Event processors in the Message Flow tab.

== Views

Views in  Studio are also visual components, and they show a graphical representation of project metadata, or properties for the active editor.

You can move, close, and add views as you please to develop your Mule project.
By default, Anypoint Studio displays the following views.

===  Package Explorer

The Mule Palette lists the available event processors, such as scopes, filters, and flow control routers, along with modules and their related operations. +
You can drag and drop any event processor to your Favorites or onto the canvas of the Mule Configuration File editor.

=== Mule Properties

The properties view allows you to edit the properties of the module that is currently selected in your canvas. +
In the example above, it is showing the properties of an HTTP Listener.

The properties view includes the DataSense Explorer which supplies real-time information about the data structure of your payload and any available inbound and outbound properties or variables.

=== Console

=== Problems
