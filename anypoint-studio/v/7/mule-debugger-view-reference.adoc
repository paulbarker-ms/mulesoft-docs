= Mule Debugger View Reference

This section contains a full description of the Mule Debugger View and all its available tools.

When the Mule Debugger starts, it points at the running Mule Runtime in Studio and waits for the Mule Event to reach its first active breakpoint. +
Until then, the Mule Debugger View displays a placeholder message:

When the Mule Event stops at a Breakpoint, the Mule Debugger View displays information about the state of the Mule Event at that breakpoint:

| Name | Description
| Name column | Displays the name of the Mule Event property +
To see any nested elements for a property, click the arrow next to the property name.

| Value column | Displays the current value of the Mule Event Property +
By selecting one property and clicking one time on its' value field, you can change that property's value. The Visual Debugger automatically stores the modified value and, so after you resume running the application, the Mule Event progresses with the modified value.

| Type column | Displays the type of the Mule Event Property

On the top right corner of the Mule Debugger View, you can find execution control tools for the Mule Debugger.
