= To Set Error Breakpoints

To set the *error* parameter for the application:

* Click the errorsÂ button image:to-set-error-breakpoints-55f71.png[error-breakpoint-icon] in the Breakpoints View.
+
This parameter causes any Event Processor in the application to become a breakpoint if it throws an error. +
In such a case, Studio stops flow execution at the event processor which threw the error, then displays the message in the Mule Debugger View.
+
Additionally, Studio displays the error throwing Event Processor surrounded by a red, dotted-line square.
