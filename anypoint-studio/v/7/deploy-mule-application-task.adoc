= To Deploy a Mule Applcation to CloudHub (Anypoint Studio)

[NOTE]
If you are using the HTTP Listener as sources for your flow, you need to set its host to *0.0.0.0* and its port to *${http.port}*. +
CloudHub then dynamically allocates a port at deployment time.

. Right click the project folder on your Package Explorer View.
. Select Anypoint Platform and then Deploy to CloudHub. +
If you don't have your Anypoint Platform credentials configured in Anypoint Studio, you'll need to provide your log in information before continuing.
. Configure the CloudHub instance to which your application is being deployed. +
Anypoint Studio uses your package name as the name for your application on CloudHub. This name is part of the domain of your deployed app. For example, naming your application application-1 makes your app's public domain +application-1.cloudhub.io+. +
+
You can also configure the runtime version. By default, Studio uses the application version you are using in your project during development. +
To reduce compatibility risks, you should always deploy to the runtime version in which your Mule project is created or the closest alternative.
+
Additionally you can configure the amount of worker and worker size for the CloudHub instance you are going to use, enable Insight, static IPs, configure log levels and properties placeholders for your application.
