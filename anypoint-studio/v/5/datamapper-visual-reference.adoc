= Anypoint DataMapper Visual Reference
:keywords: datamapper

[NOTE]
====
DataMapper will continue to be fully supported in all current and future versions of Mule ESB 3.x, however it will be removed in Mule 4.0 in favour of the *Transform Message* component (based on link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave[DataWeave] code). We recommend that if you wish to take advantage of the new capabilities of DataWeave or if you start new projects, upgrade now.

A link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-migrator[migration tool] is now included in Studio, which assists in converting a DataMapper map to DataWeave. Right click on a DataMapper, select *Migrate to DataWeave*, and follow the instructions.

If you don't see DataMapper on your palette, you can enable it by going to *Preferences* -> *Anypoint Studio* -> *Palette Profiles* and ticking the checkbox *Show deprecated Mule Components and Attributes*.

This page contains annotated images of all of the major views used in Anypoint DataMapper. It is meant as a reference for the discussions in the rest of the DataMapper documentation, to help identify each control in the UI.

== DataMapper Configuration Overview

To use a DataMapper transformer in your application, you perform the following high-level tasks:

. Drag a DataMapper transformer from the Studio Palette to the canvas, and place it in the desired location in your flow.

. Click the DataMapper transformer in the flow. Studio will display the DataMapper properties editor, shown below.
+
image:overview.jpeg[overview]

. Define the input and output properties for your mapping (this step is required for actually creating the mapping). The required tasks are:

.. Define the *Source* of your input data.

.. Define the *Type* for your input data.

.. Define the *Target* for your output data.

.. Define the *Type* for your output data.

To define the type for your input data, click the edit icon
image:edit_icon.jpeg[edit_icon] or the drop-down menu to the right of the *Type* input field. DataMapper displays a mapping configuration view according to the input type you selected. The image below displays the configuration view for input type `CSV`.

image:a1.before_mapping-CSV.png[a1.before_mapping-CSV]

Using this window, you define the input and output mapping properties, including data types and fields (for details, see link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/defining-datamapper-input-and-output-metadata[Defining DataMapper Input and Output Metadata]).

. After defining the mapping properties, click the *Create mapping* button at the bottom of the editor. The properties editor becomes the graphical mapping editor, shown below, in which you can define your data mapping proper.
+

. Define your mapping, adjusting or mapping fields as necessary.

== DataMapper Properties Editor Overview

The image below describes the different icons, indicators and tools in DataMapper's properties editor. For a description of each item, consult the numbered table below the image.

For details on creating your mapping, see link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/defining-datamapper-input-and-output-metadata[Defining DataMapper Input and Output Metadata].

image:1.before_mapping.png[1.before_mapping]

Notice the *Create mapping* button at the bottom of the image above. The button is grayed-out; it will be available only after you have defined the input and output parameters for your mapping.
