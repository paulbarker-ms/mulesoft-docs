== Updating Studio

Anypoint Studio notifies you when an update is available.

. Go to *Help* > *Install New Software ...*.
. In the _Work with_ drop down menu select *Anypoint Studio Update Site*.
. Expand the *Anypoint Studio* entry.
. Select the *Mule Server Runtime {version}* that appears listed.
