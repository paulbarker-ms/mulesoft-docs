:keywords: anypoint studio, import project, export project, share project, download project

Anypoint Studio supports the ability to import and export your projects or various project elements. The sections that follow outline the procedures to import or export information pertaining to your Studio projects. Because Studio is Eclipse-based, keep in mind that among the import/export options, there are way to import or export projects that are not tailored for Mule projects, and which are not recommended for use.

== Importing Projects into Studio

To import a project, select *File* > **Import...** Studio presents several importing options.

[NOTE]
When you import a project that was developed in an older version of Studio, the project may require some conversion, which Studio performs automatically. If you import a project developed in Anypoint Studio version 5.1.0 or older into a newer version of Anypoint Studio, then Studio asks you to perform an update to the project so that the Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project. Note that performing this conversion might imply loosing previously defined run configurations.


=== Importing a Mule Deployable Archive

. Click *Finish*. Studio loads the archive file, then displays the project in the Package Explorer under the project name you specified.
