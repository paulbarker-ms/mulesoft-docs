= DataSense Query Language
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, datasense, metadata, meta data, query metadata, dsql, data sense query language

In Anypoint Connectors which support the query functionality, the link:/anypoint-studio/v/6.5/datasense-query-editor[DataSense Query Editor] allows you to easily query and retrieve complex data stored in a remote application. To define your query, you can proceed in one of two ways:

* use the Query Editor's graphical *Query Builder*, which displays objects and fields available via the connector

* type your query directly into the *Query Text field*, using the remote application's native query language or the DataSense Query Language

To facilitate the latter, this document describes the *DataSense Query Language* for use in the *Query Editor*.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you are familiar with the link:/anypoint-studio/v/6.5/datasense-query-editor[DataSense Query Editor]. The query language described in this document is used in conjunction with the Query Editor in the editor's properties panel.

== Queries

The DataSense Query Language is, in fact, a basic subset of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL[SQL]. The tables below list the supported language elements and operators.

=== Supported Language Elements

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Language element |Purpose |Examples
|`SELECT` statement |Select fields from an object a|
`SELECT AccountID`

(To select multiple fields, separate them by commas:)

`SELECT AccountID,FirstName,Lastname`

|`FROM` clause |Specify which object to select from |`SELECT AccountID,FirstName,Lastname FROM Contact`
|`WHERE` clause |Define a comparison predicate to eliminate results that do not match |`SELECT AccountID,FirstName,Lastname FROM Contact WHERE AccountID => '500'`
|`ORDER BY` clause |Specify a field to use for sorting results |`SELECT AccountID,FirstName,Lastname FROM Contact WHERE AccountID => '500' ORDER BY LastName` +
|`OFFSET` clause |Set offset (number of results to ignore) for query results |`SELECT AccountID,FirstName,Lastname FROM Contact WHERE AccountID => '500' ORDER BY LastName OFFSET 250` +
|`LIMIT` clause |Set maximum number of results to return |`SELECT AccountID,FirstName,Lastname FROM Contact WHERE AccountID => '500' ORDER BY LastName OFFSET 250 LIMIT 1000` +
|`AND` conditional operator |Concatenates search filters defined by the `WHERE` clause, returning match if the conditions defined in both filters are true |`SELECT AccountID,FirstName,Lastname FROM Contact WHERE (AccountID => '500' AND IsDeleted = false) ORDER BY LastName OFFSET 250 LIMIT 1000`
|`OR` conditional operator |Concatenates search filters defined by the `WHERE` clause, returning match if one of the conditions defined in the filters is true |`SELECT AccountID,FirstName,Lastname FROM Contact WHERE (AccountID => '500' AND IsDeleted = false) OR Employee_Still_With_Company_c = false ORDER BY LastName OFFSET 250 LIMIT 1000`
|===

[NOTE]
====
Due to the complexity of graphical representation, the graphical Query Builder cannot display the `OR` conditional operator, although the DataSense query language supports it. To use the graphical Query Builder to construct a query that contains one or more `OR` operators, proceed as follows:

. Build your query with the graphical Query Builder, using it to select from the available objects and fields.

. Click **OK** to close the Query Builder window. Studio displays your finished query in the *Query Text* field.

. Edit your query in the *Query Text* field to include the `OR` operator. Your query will work, though you will not be able to see your query in the graphical editor.

=== Arithmetic Operators

[%autowidth,width=80%]
|===
|= |equals to
|< |less than
|<= |less or equal than
|> |greater than
|>= |greater or equal than
|<> |not equal to
|`LIKE` |includes specified pattern
|===

=== Other

[%autowidth,width=70%]
|===
|`,` (comma) |Use to separate items in a list
|`( )` |Use to delimit filter operations articulated by the `AND` conditional operator
|`'` (single quote) a|
Use to:

* ** Escape numbers if they are part of returned results and not an operational parameter (such as for the `OFFSET` or `LIMIT` clauses)
** Escape field values composed of multiple words (as in `fullName = 'Mr. John Smith'`)
|===

=== Supported Data Types

[%header%autowidth,width=70%]
|===
|Data Type |Usage Example |Notes
|String |`SELECT FullName FROM Account WHERE LastName = Smith` | 
|Date a|
`SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Birth > 1999-01-01T23:01:01+01:00`

`SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Birth > 1999-01-01T23:01:01Z`

|The date format is the link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601] format, which supports time zones
|Number |`SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Age > 30` | 
|Boolean |`SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Registered = true` | 
|Null |`SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Address = null` | 
|===

=== Limitations

The DataSense query language currently supports only the elements and operators listed in the tables above. Any other elements are currently not supported.
