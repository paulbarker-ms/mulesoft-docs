= Changing Runtimes in Studio
:keywords: runtimes, community edition, enterprise edition, anypoint, studio, deploy

When creating a new Mule Project, Studio prompts you to select a runtime; this decision is not irreversible, as the project runtime can be modified at any time. For example, you may want to change a project's runtime to take advantage of improvements that are added to new versions of Mule. Keep in mind, however, that some runtimes may be only deployable to CloudHub, and some require an Enterprise license.

== Switching a Project's Runtime

. In the *Package Explorer*, expand the contents of your project's folder, then double-click to open the *mule-project.xml* file.

. Studio displays the contents of the file as fields in which you can change the values. Use the drop-down to select the *Server Runtime* you wish to use to run your Studio project.

[TIP]
Keep in mind that a different runtime may be incompatible with some elements included in your application. Further, be aware that some runtimes are deployable only to CloudHub. Refer to link:/release-notes[Release Notes] to examine the abilities of each version of Mule runtimes.
