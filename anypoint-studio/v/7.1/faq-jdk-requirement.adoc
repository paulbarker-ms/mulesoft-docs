= About Anypoint Studio JDK Requirement

Anypoint Studio 7.1 requires Java 8 to run properly.

To verify that you have the correct JDK version installed, type `java -version` in your command line. +
If you get the error `java: Command not found`, install JDK 1.8. +
If you get a version different than 1.8, make sure to upgrade, or downgrade to 1.8.

After downloading and installing the JDK, make sure that your JDK installation is properly configured within the the JAVA_HOME environment variable by following the instructions below:

* link:/anypoint-studio/v/7.1/jdk-requirement-wx-workflow[To Configure Java JDK (Windows)]
* link:/anypoint-studio/v/7.1/jdk-requirement-lnx-worflow[To Configure Java JDK (Linux)]
* link:/anypoint-studio/v/7.1/jdk-requirement-xos-worflow[To Configure Java JDK (Mac OSx)]

Under certain circumstances, if you had a JRE installation previous to installing the JDK, your default VM could still be configured as the JRE. +
To correct this, follow the instructions below to configure Anypoint Studio to point to your JDK installation as the default VM:

* link:/anypoint-studio/v/7.1/studio-configure-vm-task-wx[To Configure Studio's Default VM (Windows)]
* link:/anypoint-studio/v/7.1/studio-configure-vm-task-unx[To Configure Studio's Default VM (Mac OSx)]
* link:/anypoint-studio/v/7.1/studio-configure-vm-task-lnx[To Configure Studio's Default VM (Linux)]

If after doing so, Anypoint Studio still does not recognize your JDK installation, consider uninstalling your the JRE.
