= Integration with Exchange 2.0

Anypoint Studio 6.4 allows you to connect to Exchange 2.0 to publish your project as a new asset.

[NOTE]
The integration with Exchange 2.0 only works for Mavenized projects.

By default, Studio 6.4 points to the Exchange 2.0 URL +https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange2/+.

== To Publish to Exchange 2.0

. In a Mavenized project, right click the project folder on your Package Explorer View.
. Select Anypoint Platform and then Publish to Exchange.
. Select your Anypoint Platform user and business group.
* Additionally you can click the "Add Account" button to use a new Anypoint Platform account.
. Review the information about your project:
* Group Id: This field is required. The group Id for your project is the Organization Id of your Anypoint Platform Organization.
* Artifact Id: This field is required. The artifact Id is the name of your project without a version. By default, Studio uses the artifact Id configured in your pom.xml file.
