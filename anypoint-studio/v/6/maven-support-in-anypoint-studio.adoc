= Maven Support in Anypoint Studio
:keywords: studio, maven, esb, version control, dependencies, libraries

The following sections describe how to enable or disable Maven support for your projects in Anypoint Studio. 

== Setting Your Maven Preferences

You can adjust your Studio preferences so that Studio automatically generates a `pom.xml` file upon project creation.  

. Navigate to *Anypoint Studio* > *Preferences* (or Windows > Preferences in Windows).
. In the *Preferences* panel, click to expand *Anypoint Studio*, then select *Maven*.
. Click *Enable automatic maintenance of pom.xml*.

+
. Click *Browse* to locate the *Maven installation home directory*.
. Click *Test Maven Configuration* to instruct Studio to run `mvn --version` in the background to validate your Maven installation. Studio produces an output of that command in a box below the button. The results flag any problems with your settings, such as a missing JAVA_HOME environment variable.

[WARNING]
====
*OS X Mavericks*

*If you are running OS X Mavericks, Studio cannot automatically find your Maven installation*, so your home directory field is blank and the Maven support boxes unchecked. 

To use Maven with Anypoint Studio on Mavericks, configure your Maven home directory manually by clicking *Maven installation home directory* > *Browse*. After you locate a valid Maven home, click *Test Maven Configuration* to verify your settings.

. When finished, click *OK* to save your changes.

== Disabling Maven Support in a Single Studio Project

If you have created Maven project in Studio and wish to disable Maven support for that particular project, right-click the project name in the *Package Explorer*, then select *Mule* > *Disable Support*.

The Disable Support option does not remove the `pom.xml` file, Studio ceases to maintain it for the project. 

You can re-enable Maven support via the Studio menu item if you _did not_ delete the `pom.xml` file. Right-click the project name in the *Package Explorer*, then select *Mule* > *Enable Support*.

[WARNING]
If you disable *Maven support* in your Studio project _and_ delete the `pom.xml` file, you cannot re-enable it via the Maven Support in Studio menu item. To re-initiate Maven support, consult the link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/enabling-maven-support-for-a-studio-project[Enabling Maven Support for a Studio Project] documentation.
