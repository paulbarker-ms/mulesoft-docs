= Enabling Maven Support for a Studio Project
:keywords: anypoint studio, maven

You may wish to take a Mule project that was already created in Anypoint Studio and add link:http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] functionality to it. Maven can make your project more easily shareable with other developers as it takes care of its dependencies and helps automate your project's build process.

This page describes how to use Studio's native support for the "mavenization" of a Mule project. 

== Mavenizing an Existing Mule Project

If you have an existing Studio project that was created without Maven support enabled, you can still add Maven support to it by "Mavenizing" it. 

. Right-click the name of your project in the Package Explorer.
. Select *Mule* > *Mavenize*.

. Studio presents a confirmation dialog, warning that although Maven support can later be disabled, this does not reset your project's classpath. Click *Yes* to confirm.

+
. Studio creates a `*pom.xml*` file for your project. You can observe the progress in the console.
. When the mavenization process is complete, the `pom.xml` file for your project appears in the Package Explorer underneath the `mule-project.xml` file.

== Running a Mavenized Project

You can now run your project on the embedded server in Anypoint Studio either as a *Mule Application* or as a *Mule Application with Maven*.

== Running Maven Life-Cycle Commands

Studio includes a Maven Support view. You can add this to your workspace projects by selecting Window > Show View > Other..., then searching for Maven Support.

[NOTE]
--
If you cannot find the _Maven Support_ view you need to install the _Maven Tools for Mule_. To do so, go to *Help* > *Install New Software*, select *Anypoint Addons Update Site* from the _Work with:_ scroll down menu and mark the *Maven Tools for Mule* option.

After installation, restart Studio to see the newly added Maven support view.
--

In the Maven Support view, you can run all the Maven life-cycle events such as clean, validate, compile, test and package.

Note: If you get any fatal errors running any of these Maven life-cycle commands, you can also run them from the command line in the Mule project's folder where the .pom file is located.

For example, you can also package your Mule project from the command line by executing the following syntax:

`mvn package`

The maven-mule-plugin packages the project in a `.zip` file and places it in a /target folder.  Copy the `.zip` file to the `apps` folder of your standalone Mule instance to run the application.

Note: You can run all the Maven commands from the command line, rather from inside Maven.
