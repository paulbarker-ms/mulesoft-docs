= Including the DataMapper Plugin (Deprecated - DataMapper)
:keywords: datamapper, migration

DataMapper is deprecated as of Mule runtime 3.7.0 and superseded by the link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/transform-message-component-concept-studio[Transform Message Component]. 


[NOTE]
====
DataMapper continues to be fully supported in all current and future versions of Mule 3.x, however it will be removed in Mule 4.0 in favor of the *Transform Message* component (based on link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave[DataWeave] code). We recommend that if you wish to take advantage of the new capabilities of DataWeave or if you start new projects, upgrade now.

A link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-migrator[migration tool] is now included in Anypoint Studio, which assists in converting a DataMapper map to DataWeave. From the Anypoint Studio Canvas, right-click a DataMapper building block, select *Migrate to DataWeave*, and follow the instructions.

If you don't see DataMapper on your palette, you can enable it by going to *Preferences* > *Anypoint Studio* > *Palette Profiles* and clicking the checkbox *Show deprecated Mule Components and Attributes*.

To deploy a Mule project that contains a DataMapper transformer:

* When deploying through Anypoint Studio, it should still work normally.
* When deploying to CloudHub, it should also work out of the box.
* However, when using for Mule Standalone 3.7.0 and newer, you must do the following before you can deploy your application:
+
. Go to the customer portal
. Select the Downloads tab
. Look in your Mule Runtime version and download the *DataMapper plugin* that corresponds to your Mule version
. Place the downloaded .zip file in the `/plugins` folder of Mule-Enterprise Standalone
