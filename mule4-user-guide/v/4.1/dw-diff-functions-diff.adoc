===== diff(Any, Any, { unordered?: Boolean }, String): Diff

Returns the structural diference between two values. It returns an Difference.
When comparing objects it can be either ordered or unordered. By default is ordered this means that two object
are not going to have a difference if their key value pairs are in the same order. To change this behaviour
specify the diffConfig parameter with {unordered: true}

var b = { age: "Test2" }
