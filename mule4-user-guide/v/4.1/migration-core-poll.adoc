= Migrating the Poll Component

In Mule 3, the `<poll>` element was used to trigger a certain flow at a fixed frequency of time. This element was also a scope which required one (and only one) message processor to live inside of it. The output of that processor would be the message that the flow receives.

.Mule 3 Example: Poll
[source,xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="poll>
    <poll frequency="1000">
        <db:select config-ref="MySQL_Configuration">
            <db:parameterized-query>SELECT * FROM PERSON></db:parameterized-query>
        <db:select>
    </poll>

    <flow-ref name="doProcess" />
</flow>
----

In Mule 4, the `<poll>` element was replaced with the `<scheduler>` element. Main differences are:

* It just triggers the flow. It's no longer a scope
* It supports both fixed frequency and cron expressions

.Mule 4 Example: Scheduler
[source,xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="poll>
    <scheduler>
        <scheduling-strategy>
            <fixed-frequency frequency="1000"/>
        </scheduling-strategy>   
    </scheduler>
    
    <db:select config-ref="MySQL_Configuration">
        <db:sql>SELECT * FROM PERSON></db:sql>
    <db:select>

    <flow-ref name="doProcess" />
</flow>
----

== Migrating a Watermark

The `<poll>` element also supported a `<watermark>` element which was used to aid and scheduled synchronizations. That element doesn't exist anymore. Instead, please read
the link:migration-patterns-watermark[Migrating Watermarks] page.
