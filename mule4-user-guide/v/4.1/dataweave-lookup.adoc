= Using `lookup` To Call External Flows

From a DataWeave transform, you can trigger the calling of a different flow in your Mule application, and whatever the flow returns is what the expression returns.

You can do this through the following expression:

`lookup(“flowName”,$)`

Which takes two parameters:

* The name of the flow that must be called
* The payload to send to this flow

.Transform
[source, dataweave, linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
{
  a: lookup("mySecondFlow",{b:"Hello"})
}
----

.Mule Flow
[source, xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="mySecondFlow">
    <set-payload doc:name="Set Payload" value="#[payload.b + ' world!' ]"/>
</flow>
----

.Output
[source, json,linenums]
----
{
  "a": "Hello world!"
}
----

Please note that only the payload returned by the invoked flow will be assigned.

Note that `lookup` function does not support calling subflows.
