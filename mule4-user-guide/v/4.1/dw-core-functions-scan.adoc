In the example above, we see that the search regular expression describes an email address. It contains two capture groups, what's before and what's after the @. The result is an array with two matches, as there are two email addresses in the input string. Each of these matches is an array of three elements, the first is the whole email address, the second matches one of the capture groups, the third matches the other one.
