= About Transformers (Deprecated)

Transformers, such as Object to XML and Object to String, are deprecated data transformation components that are distinct from the Transform component.

In this release, you should use DataWeave expressions in the Transform component to perform data transformations instead of relying the deprecated components.

Note that transformers are only available through the Compatibility module (available starting in Mule version 4.1).
