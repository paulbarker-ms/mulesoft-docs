= Profiling Mule
:keywords: anypoint studio, profiling, yourkit, monitoring, performance, memory, cpu, tuning

Profiling Mule can be useful in helping you identify memory leaks in your custom Mule ESB extensions.

To profile a Mule, you need to load a Java Profiler into the Mule instance. +
Although there are multiple Java profiler options available, we recommend using link:https://www.yourkit.com/[YourKit], a commonly used Java profiler for analyzing JVM performance.

There are two main methods to profile a Mule instance:

. <<Hooking Mule into the YourKit Agent,Configuring Mule to point to the YourKit agent>>.
. <<Running the Profiler Agent in Attach Mode>>.

[NOTE]
Configuring YourKit from the Mule configuration file requires you to restart your Mule instance. +
Running the profiler in _Attach Mode_ allows you to profile a running instance without restarting it, however certain link:https://www.yourkit.com/docs/java/help/attach_agent.jsp[restrictions] apply. +

If you're not using YourKit, visit your respective profiler's documentation to understand how to hook into the Mule-Java process.

== Hooking Mule into the YourKit Agent

In order to use your own *YourKit* profiler, you need to first link:https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/download/[download] the YourKit build to your Mule host, and add the following line to the `wrapper.conf` file located in the `$MULE_HOME/conf` path:

[source]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-agentpath:<absolute-path-to-the-agent>=delay=10000
----

This enables the YourKit agent to interact with your Mule instance.

The `<absolute-path-to-the-agent>` value varies depending on the configuration and OS of your machine. Once you downloaded and expanded YourKit package content, you can usually find the agent inside the `/bin/` folder.

[TIP]
You can download older build versions from the link:https://www.yourkit.com/download/older.html[previous Profiler releases page].

Assuming you downloaded `yjp-2013-build-13062` for Linux, for example, the entry to add in wrapper.conf should look like this:

[source]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-agentpath:/yjp-2013-build-13062/bin/linux-x86-64/libyjpagent.so=delay=10000
----

[NOTE]
The `<n>` component of the Java Service Wrapper needs to be in sequence with the rest of the `wrapper.java.additional` components in your wrapper.conf file.

By default, YourKit agent scans for an internet facing port. If a specific port is desired, you can set it by adding: +
`wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-agentpath:<absolute-path-to-the-agent>=delay=10000,port=<port>`.

A full list of start up parameters can be found in link:https://www.yourkit.com/docs/java/help/startup_options.jsp[YourKit startup options]. +
Restart Mule and set the YourKit profiler UI to connect to the host (with port, if specific port was specified).

Check link:https://www.yourkit.com/docs/java/help/running_profiler.jsp[YourKit documentation] for a more detailed explanation on how to properly launch the agent based on your operative system.

=== Connect the YourKit UI to a Local Mule

. Launch YourKit on your local machine.
. In Monitor Local Applications, double click the `MuleContainerBootstrap` process
+

+
. YourKit should now be hooked up to your Mule instance.

=== Connect the YourKit UI to a Remote Mule

. Launch YourKit on your local machine.
. In Monitor Remote Applications, click Connect to remote application.
+
image:monitor-remote-apps.png[width=500]
+
. Set up your server username and password.
. Configure the SSH authentication.
+
image:yourkit-auth.png[width=500]
+
. Click OK.
. After scanning for available applications, the YourKit should now be hooked up to your Mule instance.

== Running the Profiler Agent in Attach Mode

. link:https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/download/[Download] the profiler to the Mule server.
. Unpackage the profiler.
. Determine the PID of Mule by running `jps`.
+
[source,shell]
----
jps
----
+
. Capture the PID of the `MuleContainerBootstrap`.
+
[source,txt]
----
2838 MuleContainerBootstrap
21311 Jps
----
+
. Within the YourKit package, open the `bin` directory.
+
[source,shell]
----
cd yjp-2015-build-15086/bin
----
+
. Run `yph.sh` including the `-attach` flag with the PID of `MuleContainerBootstrap`.
+
[source,shell]
----
./yph.sh -attach 2838
----
+
. Verify the agent is attached
+
[source,shell]
----
Attaching to process 2838 using default options
The profiler agent has attached. Waiting while it initializes...
The agent is loaded and is listening on port 10001.
You can connect to it from the profiler UI.
----

NOTE: Steps above can vary in a Windows environment. Check the YourKit documentation if the steps above cannot be translated.


=== Enabling the Profiler Agent

The Profiler agent exposes the YourKit Profiler to JMX to provide CPU and memory profiling. You configure the Profiler agent with the `<management:yourkit-profiler/>` element. For more information, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/jmx-management[JMX Management].

=== Running the Profiler

To run the profiler, you run Mule with the *-profile* switch plus any extra link:http://www.yourkit.com/docs/90/help/startup_options.jsp[YourKit startup options] with multiple parameters separated by commas, for example, *-profile onlylocal,onexit=memory*. This integration pack automatically takes care of configuration differences for Java 1.4.x and 5.x/6.x.

For example:

[source]
----
./mule -profile
----

=== Embedded Mule

If you are running Mule embedded in a webapp, the Profiler configuration is completely delegated to the owning container. Launch YourKit Profiler, *Tools* > *Integrate with J2EE server* and follow the instructions. Typically, a server's launch script is modified to support profiling, and you then use this modified start script instead of the original.
