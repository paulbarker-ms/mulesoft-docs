= Sharing Custom Code
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, custom, custom transformers, custom components, maven, github

Besides all the common code that exists in a company, there are Mule specific programmatic artifacts that are worth considering sharing.

Let's name a few:

* Custom transformers - performing operations that none of the Mule stock transformers can perform (see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/creating-custom-transformers[here]).
* Custom components - typically Mule-aware or non-business oriented components, as business components are usually simple POJOs coming from pre-existing projects (see: link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/developing-components[here]).

The most convenient way to share custom code across team is to rely on Maven's dependency management mechanism. Here is an extract of a pom.xml referring to common code stored in a shared Maven library:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.acme.mulings</groupId>
  <artifactId>common-mule-project</artifactId>
  <version>1.3</version>
</dependency>
----

The Mule build plug-in will automatically bundle these extra dependencies in the /lib directory of the deployable application. In this case, the common-mule-project-1.3.jar will be added to this directory at build time, ready to be deployed and made available to the application running on Mule.
