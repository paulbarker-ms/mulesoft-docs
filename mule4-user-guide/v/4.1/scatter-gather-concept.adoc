= About Scatter-Gather

The Scatter-Gather component is a routing event processor. It concurrently sends a request event to multiple targets, then collects the responses from all routes, and aggregates them into a single message.

Scatter-Gather directs messages through two or more processing routes. Using Scatter-Gather to direct messages through only one processing route throws an exception. +
Applications do not start if Scatter-Gather has been configured with less than two routes.

Scatter-Gather executes routes concurrently instead of sequentially. Parallel execution of routes greatly increases the efficiency of your application and provides more information than sequential processing.
