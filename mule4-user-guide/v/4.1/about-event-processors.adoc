= About Event Processors

Event processors are the Mule components, connectors, and modules used to conduct backend processes for specific business logic around the Mule event.

By default, each event processor that receives a Mule event returns a new Mule message, typically with the set of attributes and payload that the processor returns. The processor passes on the new message as output to the next processor in the flow.

Note that in the Anypoint Studio UI, event processors are grouped into categories based on the actions they facilitate, such as routing (Routers) or transforming (Transformers) data. In Design Center, these processors are identified as Utils and Components.
