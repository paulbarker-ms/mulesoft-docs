= About Classloading Isolation

== The Problem

The Mule Runtime engine is developed using Java and many other third party libraries. New integrations created are bundled as Mule Applications. Those Mule Applications may also contains other Java libraries but in particular they will contain Mule extensions that provide most of the integration functionality, as for example, the HTTP connector. These extensions can also contain JAR libraries.

One of the main problems with Java in these kind of scenarios is that as many JARs are placed together and as each artifact (the runtime, applicatons and extensions) are developed and releasing independently they may contain conflicting versions of the same jar files. For example, an application may decide to use commons collections 2.1. Later on, a new extension is added to the application that requires commons collections 3.1. Since commons collections 2.1 and commons collections 3.1 have conflicting resources, the application won't work as expected.

All these problems exist because of the default classloading mechanism of the JVM.

== Mule 3 Solution

Mule 3 provided a partial solution to this problem. It basically defined a hierarchical organization of classloaders. Applications are able to see its extensions and the libraries bundled within it and the runtime libraries but can't access other applications libraries. This solves the problem of clashing of resources between different applications but the clashing of libraries between different extensions, extensions and the applications libraries or the applications libraries and the runtime libraries still remains.

== Mule 4 Solution

In Mule 4 the classloading mechanism has been changed radically in order to support all the problems depicted previously.

=== API definition

The Mule Runtime and the different artifacts (applications, domains, policies, extensions) need to have a clear API definition. This API definition defines the contract of each artifact and also limits the exposure of the artifact content to other artifacts.

*By defining a clear API for each artifact we can limit the scope of usage of classes and libraries so we can create specific classloaders that do not share everything and avoid clashing.*

==== Mule 4 API

Mule 3 exposes all the classes bundled within it's libraries to end users. This caused problems when upgrading from one runtime to another since changes in the runtime could affect custom Java classes from users.

Mule 4 includes a very well defined API. The runtime is composed of several modules each serving a different purpose. All of these modules API altogether defined the Mule 4 API. But many of these modules are for very specific purposes, like extending the runtime behaviour, and do not apply to applications or domain development. That's why a Mule API module was created, which users can reference from the applications or domains or even extensions. The API is can be found here (TODO add link to module and explain a little bit).

==== Artifact API

Whenever you create an artifact (application, domain, policy, extension) you need to declare the public API of that module. 

===== How to define the public API

Go to link:how-to-export-resources[this page] to learn how to export a resource from an artifact.

===== Considerations

* Resources and classes not exported will not be visible from other artifacts.
* Expose the minimum required set of packages and resources from your artifact.
* Do not export third party libraries unless really required.
* Never expose common third party libraries like guava, common-collections, etc. Doing so will cause clashing with other artifacts.
* Ideally expose only classes from your artifact (or the JDK).

==== Semver

Mule 4 follows https://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] for all the provided APIs.

IMPORTANT: You need to take into account the API restrictions defined for the API you are consuming. This restrictions were created to have greater flexibitility into the API changes that can be done between different versions.

==== API restrictions

All public APIs may have restrictions. These restrictions limits how you can use the API. See https://github.com/mulesoft/api-annotations[API annotations module] for more details.


=== Classloading Isolation mechanism

Once APIs are clearly defined we can prevent access to internal classes of the artifact and only make the public API accessible from outside. In order to protect the APIs we have build a custom classloading mechanism.

Lets suppose we have the following extension file structure:

----
com/example/extension/api/MyClass.class
com/example/extension/internal/Util.class
transformations/customer-to-user.dwl
license.txt
META-INF/mule-artifact/mule-artifact.json
----

And the following `mule-artifact.json` descriptor file for the extension:

[source, json, linenums]
----
{
    "name": "my-test-extension",
    "minMuleVersion": "4.0.0",
    "classLoaderModelLoaderDescriptor": {
        "id": "mule",
        "attributes": {        
            "exportedResources": [
                "transformations/customer-to-user.dwl"
            ],
            "exportedPackages": [
                "com/example/extension/api"
            ]        
        }
    }   
}
----

Then for this extension the following diagram apply:

image:simple_classloading_diagram.png[Simple classloading diagram]

Artifact Class Loader::
    This is a regular Java Class Loader pointing to the JAR files included in the extension. All files and classes of the extension will be loaded by this class loader.

Artifact Filtering Class Loader::
    This is a wrapper created over the Artifact Class Loader which will enforce the access restrictions to the extension code for foreign artifacts (the application or other plugins). It uses the content of the `mule-artifact.json` descriptor to know what things are public.

Extension code::
    This is were the Mule extension code lives. It will use Artifact Class Loader which does not have any restriction and it's only able to locate resources of the plugin itself.

Application Code::
    This is were the Mule application code lives. In order to avoid the application from accessing restricted code or resources it uses the Artifact Filtering Class Loader of the extension.

NOTE: This is an oversimplification of the whole mechanism but provides a clear view of how `mule-artifact.json` exported resources are apply within an application.
