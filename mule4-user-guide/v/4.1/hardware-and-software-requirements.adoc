Recommended minimum hardware for running Mule Runtime:

* 2GHz CPU or 1 virtual CPU in virtualized environments
* 1GB of RAM
* 4GB of storage

Adjust RAM to match your latency requirements and the size and number of simultaneous messages that applications process.

Software requirements are:

* One of the following Java versions:
+
** Oracle JDK 1.8.0 (JDK 1.8.0_161 recommended)
+
[NOTE]
--
If you are planning to run a Standalone instance of Mule Runtime Anypoint Studio freezes during start up if your installed JDK runtime is 1.8 Update 152 (1.8.0_152). It is recommended that you downgrade back to 1.8.0_151.
--
** IBM JDK 1.8
** OpenJDK 8 (JDK 1.8.0_162 recommended)
+
* For Microsoft Dynamics GP connector install Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) 8 after installing JRE or JDK.

Mule Runtime runs as a standalone server on operating systems that support one of the required Java versions. An application server is not required; however, Mule Runtime can run under one. +
Mule Runtime does not require a database unless you need to access a data store.
