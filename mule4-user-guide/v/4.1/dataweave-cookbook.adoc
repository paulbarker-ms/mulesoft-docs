|===
|Example | Description

|link:dataweave-cookbook-extract-data[Extracting Data]
| Shows common selector expressions for extracting values from a data source, such as a Mule message.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-perform-basic-transformation[Perform Basic Transformation] | Uses selectors to perform a basic format transformation. It does not use any functions.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-map[Mapping Data]
| Uses `map` to reorganize fields in a JSON array. It uses `as` to coerce a String into a Number.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-map-an-object[Map an Object]
| Uses `mapObject` to go through the keys and values in each object, and set all the keys to upper case.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-map-object-elements-as-an-array[To Map Object Elements as an Array]
| Uses the multi-value selector to pick out the keys in an object that are named "book", these are returned as an array. It then uses `map` to iterate through the array this creates.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-rename-keys[Renaming Keys]
| Renames some keys in a JSON object while retaining the names of all other keys in the output. Uses `mapObject`, `if`, `as`, and `and`.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-output-a-field-when-present[Outputting a Field When Present]
| Uses `if` with `map` to determine whether to include a field in the output. You might use it to exclude fields that contain sensitive data.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-format-according-to-type[Format According to Type]
| Uses `mapObject` to apply changes to the keys in an object, depending on the type of their corresponding values. Uses `camelize`, `capitalize`, and `pluralize` depending on the `if` and `else if` statement.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-regroup-fields[Regroup Fields]
| Uses `groupBy`, `mapObject`, and `map` to reorganize JSON and XML fields.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-zip-arrays-together[Zip Arrays Together]
| Uses `zip` to rearrange pairs of similar arrays so that they form a series of touples with the matching values from each.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-pick-top-elements[Pick Top Elements]
| Uses `groupBy` and `map` to sort a list of candidates according to their score at a test, then it splits the array to select only the top candidates.


| link:dataweave-cookbook-change-value-of-a-field[Changing the Value of a Field]
| Masks sensitive data by changing values of some keys to asterisks (`\****``). Uses `mapObject`, `if`, and `else`.


| link:dataweave-cookbook-exclude-field[Excluding Fields from the Output]
| Shows how to exclude unwanted elements from the output. Uses the `-` (remove) and `mapObject` functions.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-use-constant-directives[Use Constant Directives]
| Defines a series of constant strings and numbers in the header, these are used to filter input and to concatenate into URLs. Uses `map`, `if` and `++` to concatenate strings.


| link:dataweave-cookbook-define-a-custom-addition-function[Define a Custom Addition Function]
| Defines a function that obtains totals and subtotals through the `accumulator` function. Also performs additions, subtractions and multiplications of numeric values.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-define-function-to-flatten-list[Defining a Function that Flattens Data in a List]
| Uses `reduce`, `map`, `if`, and `splitBy` to modify and conditionally output fields from a list.


| link:dataweave-cookbook-output-self-closing-xml-tags[Outputting self-closing XML tags]
| Uses `inlineCloseOn="empty"` to close empty tags (for example, `<element2/>`).

| link:dataweave-cookbook-insert-attribute[Inserting an Attribute into an XML Tag]
| Uses the `@(key:value)` syntax to create an XML attribute.


| link:dataweave-cookbook-remove-certain-xml-attributes[Remove Certain XML Attributes]
| Defines a function that recursively checks an element and all of its children for a specific XML attribute and removes it with `-`. It also uses `mapObject`, `if` and `is` (to match types).


| link:dataweave-cookbook-include-xml-namespaces[Include XML Namespaces]
| Defines multiple XML namespaces and references these in each tag.


| link:dataweave-cookbook-reference-multiple-inputs[Reference Multiple Inputs]
| References data on the payload, a message attribute and a variable. It then processes these through `map`, `filter` and multiplications.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-merge-multiple-payloads[Merge Multiple Payloads]
| Reference data that arrives in multiple separate payloads from one single Mule event. Filters the output based on a unique identifier. Uses `map`, `using`, `as`, and `filter` functions.


| link:dataweave-cookbook-use-constant-directives[Using Constant Directives]
| Defines a `var` in the DataWeave header that builds URLs from constant directives using `++` to concatenate strings.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-parse-dates[Parsing Dates]
| Defines a function that normalizes conflicting date formats into a single, common format. Uses `mapObject`, `replace` and `as` to coerce a data type.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-add-and-subtract-time[Adding and Subtracting Dates]
| Performs multiple math operations combining different types related to date and time.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-conditional-list-reduction-via-function[Conditionally Reduce a List Via a Function]
| Defines a function that reduces a list of elements into one field. It then calls this function only when a certain field has values. Uses `map`, `reduce`, `splitBy`, `if` and `++` to append to an array.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-map-based-on-an-external-definition[Dynamic Mapping Based On a Definition]
| Transforms the payload according to definitions sent in a variable. It defines a function that applies the logic defined in the variable, using `map` and `default`.

|  link:dataweave-cookbook-pass-functions-as-arguments[Passing Functions as Arguments]
| Defines a function that expects to receive two inputs: a function to apply and an element to apply it on. The function is also recursively applied to the element's children. It uses `mapObject` `lower` `is` `if/else`.
