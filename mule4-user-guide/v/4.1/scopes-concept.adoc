= About Scopes

Scopes are Mule components that can wrap a group of operations within a flow to define a fine-grained behavior for them to apply.

They can be used to define the frequency at which to perform an operation, or to specify that a certain group of operations should be applied asynchronously.

// Some examples of scopes are the Poll and Async modules.

Scopes do nothing on their own, they must have child components to act on. +
Most scopes can be nested within each other, meaning that a single component can be affected by multiple scopes.
