//* <<unzip1>>


[[unzip1]]
===== unzip(Array<Array<T>>): Array<Array<T>>

Performs the opposite function of //* <<zip arrays>>. That is, given a single
array where each index contains an array with two elements, it outputs
two separate arrays, each with the corresponding elements of each pair.

This can also be scaled up: If the indexes in the provided array contain
arrays with more than two elements, the output will contain as many arrays
as there are elements for each index.

Note that even though example `b` can be considered the inverse function of
example `b` in //* <<zip array>>, the result is not analogous because it returns
an array of repeated elements instead of a single element. Also note that in
example `c`, the number of elements in each component of the original array
is not consistent. So the output only creates as many full arrays as it can,
in this case just one.
