= To Configure Custom Business Events

You can use Custom Business Event (`tracking:custom-event`) components to add metadata and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to your flow.

. In your Mule app, add the Custom Business Event component to a flow.
. Click to open the component.
. Type values for Display Name and Event Name.
. Optionally, add Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to capture information from the message payload:
+
* Name (`key`) for the PKI (`tracking:meta-data` element).
+
Enter a name that can be used in the search interface of Runtime Manager, and a value, which may be any Mule expression.
+
* Expression / Value (`value`) for the PKI.
+
Examples for a list of PKIs:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Name |Expression/Value
|Employee ID |`#[payload['ID']]`
|Employee Email |`#[payload['Email']]`
|Employee Git ID |`#[payload['GITHUB_ID']]`
|===

Note that key/value pairs can vary according to your business needs. Additional examples:

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Name |Expression/Value
|`price` |`700`
|price-after-discount |`#[groovy:payload.price]`
|price-after-discount |`'The price for the item is: ' #[groovy:payload.price]``
|===

== Sharing PKIs

In Studio, you can create a

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<tracking:custom-event-template name="template">
  <tracking:meta-data key="tier-level" value="platinum" />
  <tracking:meta-data key="price-after-discount" value="#[groovy:payload.price]" />
</tracking:custom-event-template>

<flow name="flow">
  <tracking:custom-event event-name="event1" inherits="template" />
  <tracking:custom-event event-name="event2" inherits="template" />
</flow>
----

And you can define how conditional custom events are fired. The code below shows how to do this:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<choice>
  <when expression="INVOCATION:debugflag = on" evaluator="header">
    <tracking:custom-event event-name="success" />
  </when>
  <otherwise>
    <tracking:custom-event event-name="failure" />
  </otherwise>
</choice>
----

In this last example, a custom event with the event name "success" is fired if the debug flag is on when the message processor is invoked. Otherwise, a custom event with the event name "failure" is fired.

`tracking:custom-event`: The top-level element for the Custom Business Event component.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="flow">
...
  <tracking:custom-event event-name="Retrieved Employee">
  </tracking:custom-event>
...
</flow>
----

When you define a custom event, you can also add metadata. Use DataWeave in the value to capture information from the message payload.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
include::_sources/business-events_1.xml[]
----

You can even add text to the expression language, as shown in the following example:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
include::_sources/business-events_2.xml[lines="15..18"]

You can also set up your flow so that metadata can be shared among events. See the XML tab for details on how to set up the `tracking:custom-event-template` global element in your flow.

You can also trigger conditional custom events to help track how messages are processed through your flow. For example, you could set up a choice router in your flow.
