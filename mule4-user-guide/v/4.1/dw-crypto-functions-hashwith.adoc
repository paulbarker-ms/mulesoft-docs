===== hashWith(Binary, String): Binary

Computes the hash of the specified content with the given algorithm name and returns the binary content.

Algorithm name can be

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|=======
|Name |Description
|MD2 |The MD2 message digest algorithm as defined in RFC 1319[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1319.txt].
|MD5 |The MD5 message digest algorithm as defined in RFC 1321[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt].
|SHA-1 SHA-256 SHA-384 SHA-512 | Hash algorithms defined in the FIPS PUB 180-2 [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/index.html]. SHA-256 is a 256-bit hash function intended to provide 128 bits of security against collision attacks, while SHA-512 is a 512-bit hash function intended to provide 256 bits of security. A 384-bit hash may be obtained by truncating the SHA-512 output.
