===== decodeURI(String): String

The decodeURI() function decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by encodeURI or by a similar routine.
Replaces each escape sequence in the encoded URI with the character that it represents,
but does not decode escape sequences that could not have been introduced by encodeURI.
The character `#` is not decoded from escape sequences.
