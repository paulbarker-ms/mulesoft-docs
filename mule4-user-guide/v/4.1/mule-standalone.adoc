//TODO: EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS.

The Mule standalone provides an enterprise-level runtime engine for the Anypoint Platform. Important features include:

* Ability to connect data to apps in ESB patterns or build APIs.
* Ability to access, query, and transform data through the DataWeave language.
* High-availability, clustering, and performance management at scale.
* Deployment as an integration worker, ESB or API gateway, on-premises or to the cloud.
* A self-tuning, reactive engine that automatically manages thread pools.
* An Error construct and Try scope for rapid debugging.
* Classloader isolation that protects Mule apps from changes to the runtime or connectors.
