= About On-Error Scopes

On-error scopes are defined within error handlers. They define the type or group of types of error it handles. So when an error occurs, the error-handler component routes the Mule error to the first on-error scope that matches the error. +
At this point, the error is available for inspection, so the on-error scopes can execute and act accordingly.

Mule supports two types of On Error Scopes. Both allow conducting matching through an error type (or group of) or through an expression (for advanced use cases). Each scope defines a different behavior for when an error occurs, which will affect
the outcome of it's owner (the flow or try scope where the error handler is defined):

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols='a,a']
|===
|On Error Scope |Description
// | Default Error Handling
// | Defined and implicitly applied by default to handle all messaging errors that are not handled by any On Error scopes. This is equivalent to an On Error Propagate with no child components for handling errors.
//
// | On Error Continue
// | If an error occurs within the Try scope, any other components in the scope are skipped, and execution continues immediately after the scope ends. +
// If a transaction is being handled, it’s committed.

// COMBAK: On-Error retry not availabel for Beta
// | On Error Retry
// | If an error occurs within the Try scope, the entire scope is attempted again. +
// There can only be one On Error Retry scope in each Error Handler.

| On Error Propagate
| Executes but propagates the error to the next level up, breaking the owner's execution. +
If a transaction is being handled, it’s rolled back.

| On Error Continue
| Executes and uses the result of the execution, as the result of its owner, as if the owner had actually completed the execution successfully. +
If a transaction is being handled, it would be committed as well.
|===

Each On Error Scope can be set up to accept a different set of error types. Both in Studio and Design Center, you can pick from a list of errors that could be raised by the components used in the error handler's owner.

You can also set up a path that accepts the type *ANY*, matching all error types that aren't used by other paths. Note that conditions are evaluated in order, so for other paths to be evaluated, the *ANY* path must always be the last.
Keep in mind that without a explicit final path for *ANY*, default error handling will apply and the error will be logged and propagated, meaning it will continue to spread as if an `on-error-propagate` had been configured.

As an alternative to mapping a path to a set of error types, you can map it to a freely defined condition. For example, you can map a path to a condition by setting the When field to:

`#[error.cause.message contains "fatal"]`

Each flow can contain only one error handler, however this error handler can contain as many On Error scopes as you see necessary. As mentioned before, by default, non explicitly handled errors are propagated.

== Reusing On-Error Scopes

Just like error handlers can be shared by exposing them globally and referencing them
in flows and try scopes, on-error scopes can be reused as well. You can define and name
an on-error scope globally and then reference it using a reference on-error component as
in the example below.

.Example: XML Configuration for Referenced On-Error
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<on-error-propagate name="sharedPropagateHandler">
  <logger message="An unhandled error has occurred."/>
</on-error-propagate>

<on-error-continue type="EXPRESSION" name="sharedContinueHandler">
  <logger message="An expression failed to evaluate."/>
</on-error-continue>

<error-handler name="reusingHandlers">
  <on-error ref="sharedContinueHandler"/>
  <on-error-continue type="ROUTING">
    <logger message="An expression failed to evaluate."/>
  </on-error-continue>
  <on-error ref="sharedPropagateHandler"/>
</error-handler>
