[[splitby1]]
===== splitBy(String, Regex): Array<String>

Splits a string into an array of separate elements. The function takes a
regular expression to identify some portion of that string, and if it finds
a match, uses the match as separator. `splitBy` performs the opposite
operation of `joinBy`.

Using the regular expression `\^&#36;.|?*+()-`, the following example finds the
the hyphen (`-`) in the input string (`a-b-c`), so it uses the hyphen as
a seperator.

[[splitby2]]
===== splitBy(String, String): Array<String>

Splits a string into an array of separate elements. The function takes a
another string to look for some portion of the input string, and if it finds
a match, uses the match as separator. `splitBy` performs the opposite
operation of `joinBy`.

The following example uses the hyphen (`-`) as the separator, but the
separator could be any other character in the input, such as `splitBy("b")`.
