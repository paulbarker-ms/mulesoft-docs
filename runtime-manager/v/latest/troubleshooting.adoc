If you ever experience problems with your deployed apps, the Runtime Manager offers several tools that can help you get to the root cause of it.


[NOTE]
Depending on the link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies[Deployment Strategy] you're using, there is currently a different set of possible troubleshooting resources available. This feature gap will be gradually reduced as new releases implement the missing features on either side.


[TIP]
See link:/runtime-manager/monitoring[Monitoring] for details on the monitoring tools of the Runtime Manager, which can also be of help you diagnose an issue.

== Troubleshooting Applications

You're able to access information about applications through the following tools:


* link:/runtime-manager/insight[Insight] – image:logo-cloud-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="CloudHub"]
image:logo-hybrid-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Hybrid Deployment"]
image:logo-server-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition"]
image:logo-pcf-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Pivotal Cloud Foundry"] Access a dashboard with key metrics, see events at an individual transaction level of detail


* link:/api-functional-monitoring/[API Functional Monitoring] – image:logo-cloud-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="CloudHub"]
image:logo-hybrid-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Hybrid Deployment"]
image:logo-server-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition"]
image:logo-pcf-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Pivotal Cloud Foundry"] Using API functional monitoring, you can automate testing and get test reports. You can test before pushing code into your repository through deploying to production. Tests can verify API functionality and validate results the API generates. You can monitor APIs at each stage of the software development life cycle and in production.


* link:/runtime-manager/viewing-log-data[View application log data] –  image:logo-cloud-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="CloudHub"]
image:logo-hybrid-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Hybrid Deployment"]
image:logo-server-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition"]
image:logo-pcf-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Pivotal Cloud Foundry"] Access a log of events ocurring to your application and the servers or cloudhub-workers they run on


* link:/runtime-manager/worker-monitoring[Worker Monitoring] – image:logo-cloud-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="CloudHub"]
image:logo-hybrid-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Hybrid Deployment"]
image:logo-server-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition"]
image:logo-pcf-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Pivotal Cloud Foundry"] Access information about the status of your application and the virtual server its running on

[NOTE]
For applications deployed to your own servers, you can export log data to third party software to view there. For applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-pcf[Pivotal Cloud Foundry], you can still see logs on Pivotal's console.

== Troubleshooting Servers

With applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/managing-applications-on-your-own-servers[your own servers], you can access information through the following tools:

* link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-analytics-software[Send Data to External Analytics Software] – image:logo-hybrid-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Hybrid Deployment"]
image:logo-server-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition"] Send data to an external tool like Splunk or ELK to view there
