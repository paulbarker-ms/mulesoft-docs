= To Create a Custom Server Property (Hybrid)

Runtime Manager enables you to define and configure server-side properties. These properties are defined as key/value pairs and are used by the JVM where the server is running. For example, you can set a property called `ENV=qa` that enables you to specify the environment of the server.

Server properties are stored in the `wrapper.conf` file on the remote server.

. From Anypoint Platform, select Runtime Manager.
. Click Servers.
. Select the server whose properties you want to configure, then click Manage Server.
. Click the Properties tab, then Custom Properties.
. Enter the name of the property in the Key field.
. Enter the value of the property in the Value field.
. Click Save.

After creating a custom property, you must restart the server for the new property to be applied to the Mule runtime configuration.
