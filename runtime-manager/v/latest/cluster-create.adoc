= To Create a Cluster using Runtime Manager (Hybrid)

== Prerequisites

Before creating a cluster, ensure you have performed the following:

* Install Mule runtime, version 3.6 or later or API Gateway runtime, version 2.0 or later.
* Install Runtime Manager Agent, version 1.1.1 or later.
* Create a server for each runtime you want to include in your cluster.

Also, note the following considerations when creating a cluster:

* None of the servers you select for creating a new cluster can contain any *previously deployed applications*.

* Multicast servers can be in the status states] 'Running' or 'Disconnected', whereas unicast servers can only be in the state 'Running'. They can't be merely in 'Created' state.

* All servers in a cluster must be running the same Mule runtime version and Agent version.

If you wish to have Object Store persistence on all servers of your cluster, you must create your cluster manually and use Quorum Management.
