== Overview

CloudHub features a backend load-balancing service designed to automate the provisioning of infrastructure components.

By using this service to proxy your CloudHub-deployed apps, you can:

. Enforce two way SSL authentication
. Enforce SSL authentication with custom certificates
. Easily configure proxy rules that map your applications to custom domains, enabling you to for example host everything under a single vanity domain
. Handle Load balancing amongst the different CloudHub workers that run your application

[NOTE]
--
This is an optional addition to your cloud infrastructure that is not included by default in all CloudHub plans. To enable it, you must first own a link:/runtime-manager/virtual-private-cloud[Virtual Private Cloud offering].
This service is designed to have one load balancer per VPC  and although each VPC supports only one domain, you can have multiple environments in the same network, meaning that you can use the same load balancer for your different environments.
--

== Using the Load Balancer

Although this feature will eventually be built into the Runtime Manager UI, currently it’s only available as a service that can be used via the link:/runtime-manager/anypoint-platform-cli[Anypoint Command Line Interface] or using the link:/runtime-manager/runtime-manager-api[Cloudhub API] through the endpoints `anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/organizations/{orgid}/vpcs/{vpcId}/loadbalancers` and `anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/organizations/{orgid}/vpcs`.

[NOTE]

A full description of `loadbalancers` and `vpcs` endpoints is available accessing your link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/anypoint-platform/#/portals[API Portal].

=== Mapping

The load balancer configuration is defined by a list of <<mapping rules>> which describe how input URL should be translated into calls to different CloudHub apps.
When creating a simple matching rule, one input address is literally matched to the defined output: the endpoint of one of your applications.
Instead of using literal matchings you can also use a *Pattern* to match a variable-like input text to an endpoint. See the <<Pattern matching>> section.

By using proxy rules, you can map a domain or subdomain to one of your Mule applications that run in CloudHub

=== Pattern matching

A pattern is a string that defines a template for matching an input text. Whatever is placed into curly brackets (`{   }`) is treated as a variable.
These variables can contain only letters (a-z) and cannot contain any other characters, such as digits, slashes, etc. The variable values can contain the following characters ‘a-z0-1.&?-_’ but no slashes.

==== Examples

===== Defining a simple rule

[source,Example,linenums]
----
‘app.example.com’ -> ‘app/example’
----

The example above literally binds these two addresses for redirect.

===== Defining a rule that includes a pattern

[source,Example,linenums]
----
‘{mypattern}.example.com’ -> `app/{mypattern}`
----

The example above causes that both ‘bookings.example.com’ and ‘sales.example.com’ match to `app/bookings` and `app/sales` respectively, as the variable `mypattern` holds this value. For input=”bookings.example.com”, the pattern can be resolved by assigning `_mypattern_=”bookings” and for input=`sales.example.com`, the pattern is resolved asignining `_mypattern_=”sales”

Depending on your design, you can choose to leverage your internal redirects to your endpoints using patterns or simply literal mappings.

=== Mapping Rules

A mapping rule is a set of fields (described below) which defines an <<Input URL>> pattern and a set of fields which describes the <<Output URL>> in terms of patterns described above.

The rule which is defined first has high priority against other ones defined after it. This means that the first matched rule will be applied. +
You can create, view and delete existing rules.


==== Rule Examples

The table below contains some rule examples:

[%header,cols="10a,20a,20a,20a,20a,10a"]
|===
|Rule # 3+^|Input URL 2+^| Output URL
|  | *Subdomain* |  *Domain*   |        *URI*        |       *appName*       |   *appURI*
| 1 | qaparm    | services.com | {appname}/{region}/ | {appname}             | {region}
| 2 | api       | mcd.com      |                     | internal-router-proxy |
| 3 | {app}.api | mcd.com      |                     | {app}-mcd             |
| 4 | api.cce   | mule.com     | /{group}/{version}/ | {group}               | /{version}/
| 5 |           | example.com  | /{app}/             | {app}                 | /
| 6 | default   | example.com  |                     | default-app           |
|===

===== Input URL

The _input URL_ is described as the following parameters, which can be specified by the user:

. *Subdomain* - a String or Pattern which defines a subdomain value of the load balancer domain.
. *Domain* - The load balancer’s domain (This value should remain constant for the same load balancer)
. *URI* - a String or Pattern that describes the Input URI.


[source,Example,linenums]
----
subdomain={app}
domain=example.com
URI=/v1/
----

The input ’echo.example.com/v1/api’ matches with the fields above, in which case the variable app=echo. The input ’echo.example.com/v2/api’ cannot be matched with the pattern above, as ‘v2’ is not in the pattern.

===== Output URL

The _Output URL_ is specified by the following fields. +
The user can use variable patterns from Input URL.

. *appName* - Output application name where the request will be forwarded to.
. *appURI* - the URI string that is passed to the resolved application.

[source,Example,linenums]
----
appName={app}
URI=/hello
----

==== Redirect URL

Sets the URI text portion that should be added in the “Location” and “Refresh” header fields of a proxied server response. Suppose a proxied server of your application returned the header field “Location: http://example.com/two/some/uri/”. The directive redirectURI=”/hello”, will change the location header to: “Location: https://example.com/hello/two/some/uri/”

=== Rule Order

Rules are grouped into groups by same subdomain name. Groups with longer subdomain names are checked first. So rules with short subdomain name (numbers or symbols) have less priority. The group with empty subdomain name is checked last.

Within a group (rules with same subdomain) the rules with longer inputURI expressions are checked first, and if they don’t match, the rules with shorter inputURI expressions are checked.


[WARNING]
--
Rules order is essential.
It’s highly recommended to pay attention to the rules’ order when creating them as it's currently not possible to edit them.
--

==== Setting a Rule Priority Order

You can set an order when creating the rule using the link:/runtime-manager/anypoint-platform-cli#cloudhub-add-lb-rule[cloudhub-add-lb-rule] command in the Anypoint-CLI by specifying an index value.

When using the API, you can't specify a priority order, but you can send a `PUT` request to the endpoint `anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/organizations/{orgid}/vpcs/{vpcId}/loadbalancers/{loadbalancerId}` and update your rules expressions to match your needs based on the order logic explained above (longer URIs within the same subdomain are checked first).

[NOTE]
--
The load balancer ID is provided to you when you create it. +
You can also perform a `GET` request to your endpoint /organizations/{orgid}}/vpcs/{vpcId}/loadbalancers` to get the ID.
--

=== Managing Certificates

==== Certificate Validation

The Cloudhub Load Balancer provides a 2-way SSL client authentication.
It allows you to provide a `.pem` file certificate to your load balancer to validate client requests.

The load balancer passes the certificate data to the API using the http headers below:

===== X-SSL-Client-Verify

This header returns either `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, or `NONE`
Only after `SUCCESS`, the client is verified. +
It returns `NONE` when the certificate is not present and `FAILED` when other validation problems occur.

===== X-SSL-Client-DN

Contains the full Distinguished Name of the client certificate.

===== X-SSL-Issuer

Contains the full Distinguished Name of the issuing certificate.

===== X-SSL-Client-Serial

Contains the serial number used by the CA to identify the client.

==== Adding Revocation Lists

If you manage your revocation list using OCSP, your revocation are defined in the certificate that you upload, so you don't need to take any extra steps.

If you manage your revocations using CRL, you can add a `crlCert` field under the `certificates` field in your JSON when creating the load balancer and specify your revocations there.
