= About VPC Network Architecture

A VPC is a logically private and isolated network hosted inside CloudHub. You can connect your private intranet to your CloudHub VPC as if they were all part of a single, private network. +
The VPC configuration exposes the DNS record "mule-worker-internal-<app-name>.cloudhub.io". This is a DNS A record which includes the IP addresses of all your workers. This DNS record cannot be accessed from outside your VPC.

Each VPC allows you to configure firewall rules to check inbound connections directly to your workers. +
Four firewall rules are created by default: 2 rules allowing your private address space through ports 8091 and 8092, and 2 rules that whitelist external requests proxied by CloudHub's shared load balancer through ports 8081 and 8092. +
All traffic that is not whitelisted in a firewall rule, is blocked by default.

The graphic below shows a default VPC architecture:

Additionally you can configure a dedicated load balancer inside your VPC. +
This service allows you to  provide custom certificates and optionally enforce two-way SSL client authentication, and  configure proxy rules that map your applications to custom domains, enabling you to for example host everything under a single vanity domain.

A VPC architecture with a dedicated load balancer would look like this:

A CloudHub Dedicated Load Balancer is assigned to a particular VPC. The dedicated load balancer then routes traffic to that particular VPC within the particular service region of the VPC.

Each Dedicated Load Balancer has a DNS A Record "<lb-name>.lb.anypointdns.net" resolving to 2 Public IP addresses of its two instances. +
Through your DNS provider, you can add a CNAME record pointing to this A record and use your own domain names to access. This DNS A record can also be reached from outside the VPC. +
Additionally a CloudHub Dedicated Load Balancer has an internal domain name to be used by applications and clients within the VPC. The structure is "internal-<lb-name>.lb.anypointdns.net".
