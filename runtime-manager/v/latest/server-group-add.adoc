= To Add a Server to a Server Group (Hybrid)

If you want to add a server to a group that is currently running an existing application, you must first stop and and delete the application before you can add the server to a group.

Before adding a server to a server group, ensure that you have:

* Installed and configured your Mule runtimes.
* Installed and configured the Runtime Manager Agent.
* Created a server in Runtime Manager.

Remember that you must first <<Add a Server, register>> each of the servers to Runtime Manager, by downloading and installing the same version of the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule[Mule runtime] and then running the link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[amc_setup] script on each.

. From the *Servers* screen, click a server to view the additional menu, and click *Add Servers*:
