= To Add a Server to a Cluster (Hybrid)

To add a server to a cluster, all servers in a cluster must run the same version of Mule runtime and of the Runtime Manager Agent.

[NOTE]
Remember that you must first <<Add a Server, register>> each of the servers in the cluster, by downloading and installing the same version of the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule[Mule runtime] and then running the link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[amc_setup] script on each.
A cluster can only be made up of servers that are not already in a server group or part of another cluster.
