[TIP]
This document describes how to call the CloudHub API. For information on how to perform these same tasks more easily via the Runtime Manager UI, see link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] and its child pages.

The alerts API allows you to create alerts. All resources or methods that return or accept a type (except where noted) use the application JSON type. As an example, here's a Curl command that would create an alert.

[code]
----
curl --verbose -XPOST 'https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/v2/alerts' -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{
  "name": "failure",
  "severity": "INFO",
  "condition": {
  	"resourceType": "cloudhub-application",
    "type": "deployment-failed",
    "resources": [
      "<CLOUDHUB APPLICATION NAME>"
    ]
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "email",
      "emails": [
        "me@example.com"
      ],
      "subject": "subject line",
      "content": "deployment failed for ${resource}"
    }
  ]
}' -H "content-type: application/json"
