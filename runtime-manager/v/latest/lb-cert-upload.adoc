The certificate that you upload to your Load Balancer must be contained in one _pem_ encoded and unencrypted file.
This file must contain the entire certificate chain ordered sequentially, as shown in this example:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
| Certificate | Example
| The Primary Certificate | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- +
(Your Primary SSL certificate: your_domain_name.crt) +
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
| The Intermediate Certificate | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- +
(Your Intermediate certificate: DigiCertCA.crt) +
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
|===

It is not required to include the root certificate in the certificate chain. However, you must include the ASCII armor in each certificate.


When creating a load balancer, you can include an SSL Endpoint using Runtime Manager or using the `cloudhub load-balancer create` command from the CLI. 

After creating a load balancer, you can upload an SSL Endpoint using Runtime Manager or using the `cloudhub load-balancer ssl-endpoint add` command from the CLI.
