= FAQ: Where To Place a VPC Inside my Organization

As an organization administrator, you can create a VPC and share it with any business group within your main organization. +
However, once the VPC is inherited by a business group, only the administrator of said business group can operate the VPC (i.e. set worker's firewall rules, assign it as default to an environment within that business group, etc). +

If no business group association is specified, or if your organization does not have any business group, the VPC ownership remains associated with the main organization. +
The organization under which the VPC is created is the VPC Owner and this organization's administrator is the only one who can share the VPC.

A CloudHub organization administrator or a Business Group Owner can create or update an existing VPC (owned or inherited) to make it the default for either the region, the environments or both. +
However, if such association already exists, it's overwritten by the requested VPC.

VPCs can only be shared vertically from the main organization to one of its business groups, or from a business group to one of its child business groups. +
You cannot share a VPC created by a business group with another one of higher hierarchy.

It's recommended to create your VPC in your master organization, and to share it with the other business groups.
