CloudHub provides a set of tools to help you deploy and manage your applications seamlessly from the command line.

Here's a summary of the commands:

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Command |Description
|<<cloudhub-list>> |List all your applications on CloudHub and their status
|<<cloudhub-create>> |Create a new application on CloudHub
|<<cloudhub-update>> |Update an application, its workers, and its environment variables
|<<cloudhub-delete>> |Delete an application
|<<cloudhub-logs>> |List the last lines (tails) of the logs from your application
|===

== Installation

To install the tools:

. Install the link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[Java Development Kit] on your computer. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to where you installed Java on your computer.
. Download the CloudHub distribution link:_attachments/cloudhub-cli-1.0.1.zip[cloudhub-cli-1.0.1.zip] file.
. Unzip/extract the distribution in a location on your local machine.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ unzip cloudhub-cli-1.0.1.zip
----
+
The zip file creates the `cloudhub-cli-18-SNAPSHOT` directory.
+
. If you are using a Mac or Linux computer, ensure that the `cloudhub-` commands are executable by using a command such as `chmod 700 cloudhub-*`.
. Add the bin directory to your PATH.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ export PATH=/path/to/cloudhub-cli-18-SNAPSHOT/bin:$PATH
----
+
. Optionally set the following environment variables to make invoking the commands easier:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Environment Variable |Description
|CLOUDHUB_USERNAME |Your Anypoint Platform username
|CLOUDHUB_PASSWORD |Your Anypoint Platform password
|CLOUDHUB_DOMAIN |Your application domain
|===

This makes the domain, username, and password arguments optional in the commands below.

*Note*: Use the `--help` parameter with a command to see what options are available.


== Accessing Different Environments

Your username controls which environment you're accessing and is of the form `user@environment`. For example, if your username is joe and you have an environment called "Development", your username is `joe@Development`. If you don't specify an environment, it defaults to `production`.

== cloudhub-list

Example:

[source,bash]
----
$ cloudhub-list
hello: STARTED
----

// Click for Help

== cloudhub-create

The first time that you create your application, a `cloudhub.properties` file is created with all of the additional parameters (location of your file, number of workers, and all system properties). Each time you update your application, these properties are automatically loaded from this `cloudhub.properties` file.

Example:

[source,bash, linenums]
----
$ cloudhub-create -d test -f ../web/target/test-classes/hello.zip -w 1 -D foo:bar hello:test
Creating application...
Creating properties file...
Application created!
Uploading application...
Application uploaded!
----

// Click for Help

== cloudhub-update

Example:

[source,bash]
----
cloudhub-update
----

// Click for Help

== cloudhub-delete

Example:

[source,bash]
----
$ cloudhub-delete -d app
----

// Click for Help

== cloudhub-logs

Lists the last lines (tails) of the log results from your application. Output continues to tail the logs until you press CTRL-C.

Example:

[source,bash]
----
$ cloudhub-logs
...
INFO    11-04-05 07:21:41   [ApplicationServiceImpl] Successfully deployed [test]
----
