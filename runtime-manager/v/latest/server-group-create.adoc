= To Create a Server Group (Hybrid)

Before creating a server group, ensure that you have:

* Installed and configured your Mule runtimes.
* Installed and configured the Runtime Manager Agent.
* Created a server in Runtime Manager.



To create a server group in Runtime Manager:

. Download and install link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/enterprise-integration[Mule runtime] on two or more physical or virtual servers in your site.
. Sign in to the Anypoint Platform and click *Runtime Manager*:

. Click the *Servers* tab and use the token to <<Add a Server, register each server to the platform>> via its command line

This takes you to a settings page where you can select what servers to include in your new group and give it a name:

. Give the server group a name

+
[TIP]
The group name must not start or end with a dash, must be at least 3 characters long, no more than 40 characters, must be unique, and contain only letters, numbers, or dashes.

. Click the checkbox for each server to include in the group, and click *Create Group*.

+
[NOTE]
All servers in a server group must be running the same Mule runtime version and the same Agent version. Also, a server group can be created from servers that all display the status 'Running' or 'Disconnected' but these can't be mixed with servers that display the status 'Created'. You can on the other hand create a server group out of only servers that display the status 'Created'.
