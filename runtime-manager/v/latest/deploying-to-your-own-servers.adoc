[TIP]
Before you can deploy to a server, you must first link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/installing[install] the Mule Runtime and then link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[register it on the platform].

You can deploy a Mule application to a local server via:

* link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#cloud-console-on-premises-deployment[The Runtime Manager cloud console]
* link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#on-premises-console-on-premises-deployment[The Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition]

// * *Anypoint Studio* - Right-click your project and click *Deploy to Anypoint Platform* -> *Cloud*.


This document describes the options on the *Deploy Application* page, which is identical in all of the cases above.


[TIP]
====
If you’re interested in requesting the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, please contact your sales representative.

Additionally, you can also deploy to your servers through:

* The *link:/runtime-manager/runtime-manager-api[Runtime Manager API]*
* Using the *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-maven-plugin[Mule-Maven Plugin]*

On the other hand, deploy an app to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub], see link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[Deploying to CloudHub].
====


[NOTE]
You must avoid having dual management over one same server. When using Runtime Manager, other deployment and management methods and/or tools – MMC and manual deployment – must be avoided.

== Deploying an Application

=== From Anypoint Platform

. Sign in to the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] or click *Sign up* on the sign on page.

. Click *Runtime Manager*:

+
. Click *Deploy application*:
+
image:DeployAppFromConsole.png[DeployAppFromConsole] 
+
[TIP]
*Note*: For more information on the *Servers* tab, see link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[Managing Servers].
+
.  The Deploy Application page opens:
+

=== From Anypoint Exchange

. From Anypoint Platform, select Runtime Manager.
. Click Applications, then click Deploy Application.
. Provide a name for your application.
. Select a deployment target from the drop-down list.
+
The target must be a registered server, server group or cluster.

. Click Choose File, then select Import File from Exchange from the drop-down menu.
+

. Enter the name of your application in the search box.
+
You can see a full list of applications in Anypoint Exchange. Your application should appear in the search results list.

. Select the application you want to deploy, then select a version from the drop-down list.
. Click Deploy Application.

The new application appears in the list of deployed applications in the Applications tab.

=== From Sandbox

If you created an application in a sandbox environment and tested it, you probably will eventually want to migrate it to production.


. Once logged into your Anypoint Platform account, go to one of your non-sandbox environments
. In the *Applications* tab, click the *Deploy Application* button
+

. Name your deployment, then select the deployment target. The target must be a registered server, server group or cluster.

+
image:deploying-to-your-own-servers-cb103.png[]

. Then when picking the application file, instead of uploading a new file, click *Get from sandbox*.
+
image:deploying-to-your-own-servers-561b4.png[]

. This opens a window that displays all of your applications running in sandbox environments on servers on-premises, sorted by environment. Select an application and click *Apply*.

+
image:deploying-to-your-own-servers-862c0.png[]

. Continue setting up your deployment as you would with any normal deployment.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, only applications that are deployed to user-managed runtimes are displayed in this list. Applications deployed to CloudHub workers that are in sandbox environments can only be promoted to run on other CloudHub workers.

Also, be mindful of the Mule runtime versions being used by the servers in both environments. They should both use the same or at least compatible versions. See link:/release-notes/updating-mule-versions[Updating Mule Versions].
====

==== Limitations

* Keep in mind that if you're deploying to a production target that is of a different type (ie: cluster vs single server) or that has a different Mule runtime version installed in it, there could be compatibility issues.
* Only a user with permissions on both the sandbox environment and the destination production environment can move applications between them.
* To avoid domain name conflict, an application cannot exist in two environments at the same time. Alter the application's name slightly to deploy it to another environment.
* Runtime Manager prevents you from having duplicate application names in a single environment. If a name is already taken, you will be prompted to provide a new name.

////
=== From Anypoint Studio

. With your application open in Anpoint Studio as a Mule Project, right-click on the project node in the package explorer. Then select *Deploy to Anypoint Platform* > *Runtime Manager* from the cascading menu.
+
image:deploy+to+cloudhub.png[deploy+to+cloudhub]
+
. If this is your first time deploying in this way, a popup menu asks you to provide your login credentials for the Anypoint Platform. Studio stores your credentials and uses them automatically the next time you deploy to CloudHub.

+
[TIP]
You can manage these credentials through the Studio *Preferences* menu, in *Anypoint Studio* > *Authentication*.

. After you sign in, the Deploy Application menu opens.

== Creating an Application Name

Every application requires a unique application name. The application domain identifies your application in the Runtime Manager. Valid names contain alphanumeric characters and dashes, and contain at most 40 characters. If the name is valid, the Runtime Manager alerts you whether it is available or already reserved by another user.

image:DeployAppName.png[DeployAppName]

== Deployment Target

If you already have servers link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[registered to the Anypoint Platform], you will see a Deployment Target field that lets you specify where you want to deploy your application:

* On the CloudHub worker cloud
* On a server on-premises, in a different cloud repo, a server group, or a cluster

This document focuses on deploying to on-premises servers, for more information on deploying to CloudHub, see link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[Deploying to CloudHub]


== Application File

Upload a new file for deployment. Click the *Choose file* button, select your application file, and then click *Open*. You can also click the *Get from sandbox* button to copy a file from a non-production environment into your current environment. (If the Get From Sandbox button does not appear, you may first need to create a non-production environment to view this option.) 

*Note*: The application file size limit is 100 MB.

=== Runtime Version

Since the server, server group or cluster you select implicitly has a single Runtime version installed in it, this is determined automatically by the server you select.

Keep in mind that servers in a cluster must have the same Runtime version installed in all of them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the runtime version in the server or servers is the same Mule version used to develop your application. For example, if you deploy to a server that runs Mule runtime 3.5.0 and your application uses the new HTTP connector introduced in Mule 3.6 and newer, your application won't deploy and the log contains errors.
====

== Insight Tab

The Insight tab lets you specify metadata options for the Insight analytics feature. For more information, see link:/runtime-manager/insight[Insight].

image:deploying-to-your-own-servers-c5057.png[]

== Properties Tab

The Properties tab enables you to specify properties that the application uses during deployment and while running. Application properties are defined as key/value pairs.

image:deploy-app-properties-tab.png[]

For example, you can define properties for `db_user` and `db_password` that specify credentials for connecting to a database.

Specifying properties in Runtime Manager enables you to define properties in one place rather than having multiple application property files for a single application in multiple environments. You can also define application-specific properties in a properties file, then later add environment-specific properties from Runtime Manager during deployment

After deploying an application, you can modify application properties or create new ones from the Application Settings page. The values of properties defined on this tab override any application properties defined in the `mule-app.properties` or other properties of the Mule runtime.

If you change properties after an application is deployed, you must restart the application and any server group or cluster where the application is deployed.

When deploying an application using the Get From Sandbox feature, your new application will inherit any properties defined in the original application. You can update these properties as required before deploying the application. 

The following security considerations apply to these properties:

* Values sent between Runtime Manager and the Mule runtime are encrypted over HTTPS.
* Values stored in the Runtime Manager internal database are encrypted.
* By default, Runtime Manager does not display the values of the properties in the UI. 
* Only users that have access to the Application Setting page can view these properties.

== Logging Tab

Each Mule runtime stores log files in its respective local drive. The Logging tab of the deploy menu lets you configure how these logs are structured. Specifically, it lets you set how the different logging levels are applied (INFO, DEBUG, WARN, or ERROR), so that they don't follow the default usage.

image:deploying-to-your-own-servers-198b4.png[]

[TIP]
Configuring this via the logging tab has the same effects as editing the log4j2.xml file on your Mule runtime. For details on how to do that, see
see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/logging-in-mule#configuring-custom-logging-settings[logging in Mule]. You can also check a reference to  link:https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html[log4j2 configuration] in Apache's documentation.



== Configuring a Deployed Application

You can change the application file of a deployed application

* Select your application in the *Applications* page to open its corresponding panel
* Click *Choose File* to upload a new file

[TIP]
Keep in mind that your application will then experience a moment of downtime while the new version you just selected is launched in the server, server group or cluster.


== Deployment Errors

If an error occurs and the application cannot be deployed, the application status indicator changes to `Failed`. You are alerted in the status area that an error occurred. Check the log details for any application deployment errors. You need to correct the error, upload the application, and deploy again.
