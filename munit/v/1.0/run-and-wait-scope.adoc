= Run and Wait Scope
:version-info: 3.7.0 and newer
:keywords: munit, testing, unit testing

== Functionality

The Run and Wait scope provided by MUnit allows you to instruct MUnit to wait until all asynchronous executions have completed. Hence, test execution does not start until all threads opened by production code have finished processing.

== Defining Run and Wait

In some cases, your production code may launch threads that produce key results. Usually, these are the results that you want to validate. But if those results are being processed in a separate thread, your test runs and finishes before that separate thread completes, that is, before the results that you want to validate are available. To avoid this problem, you can use the `run-and-wait` scope.

For the purposes of this document, we assume that we are testing the following Mule code:

[source, xml, linenums]
.Test code
----
<flow name="exampleFlow">
  <async>
      <expression-component>
          Thread.sleep(3000);
      </expression-component>
  </async>
</flow>
----

The goal is to make your test wait until the `exampleFlow` has finished. To do so, implement the test as shown below.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="testFlow">
    <synchronize:run-and-wait timeout="16000"> //<1>
        <flow-ref name="exampleFlow"/> //<2>
    </synchronize:run-and-wait>
</flow>
----
<1> Define `run-and-wait` scope.
<2> Call the actual production code to test.

|`timeout`
|Defines the time (in milliseconds) to wait for all the threads to complete.

TIP: Using this tool is the only way to run an MUnit test on Mule batch jobs.

== Defining Run and Wait With Java Code

[[java-api-usage]]
=== Java API usage

To define the `run-and-wait` scope in Java, you need to implement the `Synchronizer` abstract class:

[source,java,linenums]
----
import org.mule.construct.Flow;
import org.mule.Synchronizer;
import org.mule.api.MuleEvent;

public class TheTest extends FunctionalMunitSuite {

  @Test
  public void test() throws Exception{
    final Flow flow = (Flow) muleContext.getRegistry().
      lookupFlowConstruct("testFlow");   //<1>

    Synchronizer synchronizer =
      new Synchronizer(muleContext, 12000){  //<2>

        @Override
        protected MuleEvent process(MuleEvent event) throws Exception{

            return flow.process(event);  //<3>
        }
    };

    MuleEvent event = testEvent("payload");
    synchronizer.runAndWait(event);   //<4>
  }
}
----
<1> Obtain the flow to test.
<2> Create a new `Synchronizer` and implement the abstract method `process`.
<3> Usually what you want to do is run a flow.
<4> Call the `Synchronizer` implementation defined in Note #2.
