= Verify Message Processor
:version-info: 3.7.0 and newer
:keywords: munit, testing, unit testing

== Overview

The Verify feature provided by MUnit allows you to define _verifications_ in order to validate a message processor's calls.

For example, you can validate if a specific message processor has been called with a particular set of attributes a specific number of times.

== Defining Verifications

When defining a verification, we are telling MUnit to fail a test if the verification is not successful.

TIP: You can define verifications over any message processor, even if you haven't created a mock for it.

For the purposes of this document, we assume we are testing the following Mule code:

[source, xml, linenums]
.Test code
----
<flow name="exampleFlow">
  <set-payload value="#['real_payload']" doc:name="Real Set Payload"/>
</flow>
----

=== Defining Message Processor To Verify

When defining a verify, we make use of the `verify-call` message processor.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mock:verify-call messageProcessor="mule:set-payload" times="1"/>
----

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute Name |Description

|`messageProcessor`
|Describes which message processor we want to mock. The description takes the form `{name-space}:{message-processor-name}`. It supports regular expressions.

|`times`
|*(Default = 1.)* Defines the verification as successful if the message processor was called _N_ and only _N_ number of times.

|`atLeast`
|Defines the verification as successful if the message processor was called a minimum of _N_ number of times.

|`atMost`
|Defines the verification as successful if the message processor was called maximum of _N_ number of times.

|===

NOTE: By default, the `verify-call` message processor assumes _times=1_ if no value is specified.

NOTE: The attributes `times`, `atLeast`, `atMost`, are mutually exclusive. Only one should be used.

The `messageProcessor` attribute accepts regular expressions. You could create the same verification as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
.Verify using regular expressions
----
<mock:verify-call messageProcessor=".*:set-payload" times="1"/>
----

In the example above, we define a verification for a message processor named `set-payload`, disregarding which namespace the message processor belongs to.

TIP: The regular expression language is the same as Java.

=== Defining Verifications with Message Processor Attributes

The definition of a verification is based on matchers, that is, parameters that match features of the desired message processor. Defining a verification solely on the name of the message processor largely limits your scope and actions. For this reason, MUnit allows you to define a verify by defining matchers over the value of a message processor's attributes.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<mock:verify-call messageProcessor="mule:set-payload">
  <mock:with-attributes>
    <mock:with-attribute whereValue="#['Real Set Payload']" name="doc:name"/>
  </mock:with-attributes>
</mock:verify-call>
----

You can define as many attributes as you deem necessary to make the verification as representative as possible. When defining an attribute, you do so by defining:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute Name |Description

|`name`
|The name of the attribute. This value is literal, it doesn't support regular expressions.

|`whereValue`
|The value that the attribute of the real message processor should contain. It accepts MEL expressions. If left as a literal, it assumes a string value.

|===

TIP: If the attribute you wish the Verify message processor to match is similar to `config-ref` and resolves to an actual bean, you can use the MUnit MEL function `getBeanFromMuleContext('bean_name')`. This function inspects the Mule registry and returns the bean with the matching name if present. See link:/munit/v/1.0/assertion-message-processor[Assertion] for details.

== Defining Verifications with Java Code

The example below shows how to reproduce the same behavior described above, using the MUnit Java API.

[source,java,linenums]
----
import org.junit.Test;
import org.mule.munit.common.mocking.Attribute;
import org.mule.munit.runner.functional.FunctionalMunitSuite;

public class TheTest extends FunctionalMunitSuite {

  @Test
  public void test() {
    Attribute attribute = Attribute.attribute("name").
      ofNamespace("doc").withValue("Real Set Payload"); //<1>

    verifyCallOfMessageProcessor("set-payload") //<2>
    .ofNamespace("mule")                        //<3>
    .withAttributes(attribute)                  //<4>
    .times(1);                                  //<5>

  }
}
----
<1> Define the real message processor attribute to match.
<2> Define the message processor's name to verify (accepts regular expressions).
<3> Define the message processor's namespace to verify (accepts regular expressions).
<4> Set the message processor's attribute defined in Note #1.
<5> Define the amount of times (could also be `atLeast(1)` or `atMost(1)`).

INFO: Java does not provide default values for parameters `times`, `atLeast` or `atMost`, so you need to provide the value of the parameter that you use.
