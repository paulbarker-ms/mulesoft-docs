= MUnit Maven Support
:version-info: 3.7.0 and newer
:keywords: munit, testing, unit testing

MUnit provides a Maven plugin that allows you to run your MUnit tests as part of your continuous integration environment.

== Setting Up Your pom.xml File

MUnit is a composition of several modules, all of which are necessary to run your MUnit test. Maven offers as much flexibility as possible.

For MUnit to run properly with Maven, you need to add a few sections to your `pom.xml` file.

TIP: If you are using Anypoint Studio, Maven integration is already solved for you. See link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/using-maven-in-anypoint-studio[Using Maven in Anypoint Studio] for details.

NOTE: This documentation assumes you have the following properties in your `pom.xml`: `<munit.version>` and `<mule.munit.support.version>`.
+
Do not combine MUnit modules of different versions. That is, the `munit.version` should be the same across all MUnit artifacts in your `pom.xml`, like the plugin or the runner.
+
Regarding the Mule MUnit support module, the `mule.munit.support.version` should match the `mule.version`. For example, `3.7.0` version of the support module would be compatible with `3.7.0`, `3.7.1`, `3.7.2` and other versions of Mule, but not necessarily with `3.6.0`.

=== MUnit Maven Plugin

The MUnit Maven Plugin allows you to run MUnit tests from Maven. To enable the plugin, add the following section to your `pom.xml`.

[source, xml, linenums]
.MUnit Maven Plugin
----
<build>
  <plugins>
  ...

    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.mulesoft.munit.tools</groupId>
      <artifactId>munit-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${munit.version}</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>test</id>
          <phase>test</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>test</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>

  ...
  </plugins>
</build>
----

==== MUnit Folder

All the MUnit Test Suite files reside in `src/test/munit`. You need to tell Maven to add this folder to the classpath.

[source, xml, linenums]
.MUnit Folder
----
<build>
...

  <testResources>
    <testResource>
      <directory>src/test/munit</directory>      // <1>
    </testResource>
    <testResource>
      <directory>src/test/resources</directory>  // <2>
    </testResource>
  </testResources>

...
</build>
----
<1> The actual MUnit test folder.
<2> The normal resources folder, usually used to store other files.

=== MUnit Dependencies

Listed below are the _minimal artifacts_ required to enable MUnit to run from Maven.

[source, xml, linenums]
.MUnit Dependencies
----
<dependencies>
...

  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.mulesoft.munit</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule-munit-support</artifactId>
    <version>${mule.munit.support.version}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.mulesoft.munit</groupId>
    <artifactId>munit-runner</artifactId>
    <version>${munit.version}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>

...
</dependencies>
----

=== MUnit Repositories

MUnit artifacts are deployed in the Mule Maven repositories, which you've probably seen before.

[source, xml, linenums]
.Repositories
----
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>mulesoft-releases</id>
      <name>MuleSoft Releases Repository</name>
      <url>http://repository.mulesoft.org/releases/</url>
      <layout>default</layout>
    </repository>
</repositories>
----

You also need to add the Plugin repository.

[source, xml, linenums]
.Plugin Repositories
----
<pluginRepositories>
  <pluginRepository>
    <id>mulesoft-release</id>
    <name>mulesoft release repository</name>
    <layout>default</layout>
    <url>http://repository.mulesoft.org/releases/</url>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
----

TIP: If you code your MUnit tests in Java, you don't need the MUnit Maven Plugin nor the plugin repository.

== The MUnit Maven Plugin

The MUnit Maven Plugin makes it possible to run the XML-based tests. It has a few features we discuss below.

=== Running MUnit Tests From Maven

[source,console]
.Running MUnit tests in a project example
----
mvn clean test
----

==== Running a Specific MUnit Test Suite

You can instruct MUnit Maven Plugin to run only tests that belong to a specific test suite.

To do this, we use the property `munit.test`.

[source,console]
.Running a specific MUnit Test Suite example
----
mvn clean test -Dmunit.test=<regex-test-suite>
----

As you can see, the property `munit.test` accepts regular expressions. The expression is applied to the name of the MUnit Test Suite file. The regular expression language is the Java implementation.

The following is a valid example:
[source,console]
----
mvn clean test -Dmunit.test=.*my-test.*
----

You can leverage this feature by adding naming conventions to your MUnit Test suites.

==== Running Specific MUnit Tests

In the same way that you instruct MUnit to run one test suite, you can also tell it to run a specific test inside that test suite. To do so, we again make use of the property `munit.test`, with one addition:

[source,console]
----
mvn clean test -Dmunit.test=<regex-test-suite>#<regex-test-name>
----

The addition is the special character `#`. To the right of it you should type the test name. As you can see, it also accepts regular expressions. The expression is applied to the attribute `name` of the MUnit Test.

The following is a valid example:
[source,console]
----
mvn clean test -Dmunit.test=.*my-test.*#.*test-scenario-1.*
----

TIP: The tests inside the MUnit Test Suite that don't match the regular expression is flagged as *ignored*.

=== Skip MUnit Tests

==== Skipping All Tests

When building your application, you may want to prevent a test from running. MUnit leverages the same mechanism as Maven, so if you wish to skip tests, you can make use of the parameter `skipTests`.

[source,console]
.Skipping Tests example
----
mvn clean package -DskipTests
----

==== Skipping Only MUnit Tests

MUnit also comes with another property that only prevents MUnit tests from running.
While at the same time allowing any other test, like JUnit tests, to keep running.

If you wish to skip only MUnit tests, you can make use of the parameter `skipMunitTests`.

[source,console]
.Skipping MUnit Tests example
----
mvn clean package -DskipMunitTests
----

TIP: The property `skipMunitTests` applies only to the XML based MUnit tests.

=== General Configurations

The MUnit Maven Plugin offers a minor set of configurations.

==== Redirecting Logs

By default, logs are output to the console, but you can redirect them to a file.

[source, xml, linenums]
.Redirecting logs example
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.munit.tools</groupId>
  <artifactId>munit-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${munit.version}</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>test</id>
      <phase>test</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>test</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
  <configuration>
    <logToFile>true</logToFile> //<1>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----
<1> Redirect logs.

The log outputs to `target/surefire-reports/munit.-output.txt`.

==== Setting System Variables

You may wish to define specific system variables needed for your MUnit test to run successfully. The example below shows how you can send them.

[source, xml, linenums]
.Sending system variables
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.munit.tools</groupId>
  <artifactId>munit-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${munit.version}</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>test</id>
      <phase>test</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>test</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
  <configuration>
    <systemPropertyVariables>   //<1>
      <my.property.key>my.property.value</my.property.key>
    </systemPropertyVariables>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----
<1> Sends variables.

=== Dynamic Ports

When testing a Mule application in a continuous integration (CI) environment, the following scenario is not uncommon:

`Your application tries to open a specific port. The port is already in use. The application fails with a port binding exception.`

This is bound to happen and the easy solution to this problem is to have your application use a free port.
The MUnit Maven Plugin comes with a built in feature to do just that.

`MUnit Dynamic Ports` instructs the MUnit Maven Plugin to look for unbound ports and reserve them before running the tests over the Mule application. Each port selected is placed in a system property under the name indicated in the configuration.
Afterwards the port number can be acquired by the application by the use of placeholders.

TIP: The Ports to be selected by the plugin are taken from the following range: `[40000,50000)`

NOTE: Dynamic Ports feature is only available as part of the MUnit Maven Plugin, thus you can not expect this feature to work when running tests from inside Anypoint Studio.


==== Enabling Dynamic Ports

In order to enable the feature, you need to add the following code to the `configuration` section of the MUnit Maven Plugin:

[source, xml, linenums]
.Dynamic Ports Configuration
----
<dynamicPorts>
  <dynamicPort>a.dynamic.port</dynamicPort>
</dynamicPorts>
----

If you have the `${http.port}` placeholder in your application, the configuration looks something like:

[source, xml, linenums]
.Example
----
<dynamicPorts>
  <dynamicPort>http.port</dynamicPort>
</dynamicPorts>
----

==== Preparing Your Application

Of course all this comes with a trade off.
The part of the application trying to make use of a port must be parametrized by use of a placeholder.
For instance, you may want to have your Mule application listening for HTTP traffic. In order to do that you should provide the following configuration:

[source, xml, linenums]
.HTTP Simple Application
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" host="0.0.0.0" port="8081"/>
<flow name="httpFlow">
    <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/"/>
</flow>
----

Now this application always listens in port `8081`. To make it dynamic, change it to:

[source, xml, linenums]
.HTTP Simple Application with dynamic port
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" host="0.0.0.0" port="${http.port}"/> //<1>
<flow name="httpFlow">
    <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/" />
</flow>
----
<1> Notice the placeholder `${http.port}`.

With the application coded in this way, and the configuration of Dynamic Ports in place your application starts each run listening on a different port.

=== Coverage

MUnit used to have a basic coverage feature only available from Anypoint Studio.
Since MUnit version `1.2.0` this feature is also available from the command line by the use of the MUnit Maven Plugin.

==== Objective

The MUnit Coverage feature provides a metric on how much of a Mule application has been executed by a set of MUnit tests.
This lets the users obtain a quality metric for the application.
For more information, see this link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage[Wikipedia article on Code Coverage].

It's worth noticing, MUnit Coverage is based on the amount of message processors executed.
MUnit Coverage provides metrics for:

* *Application overall coverage*: An average of the items below.
* *Resource coverage*: Refers to each Mule configuration file under `src/main/app`. Each of is considered a resource by MUnit Coverage.
* *Flow coverage*: Refers to any of the following `Flows`, `Sub-flows`, and `Batch jobs`.

==== Configuration

The following section covers how to configure MUnit Coverage.

A basic set of Coverage related features is in Anypoint Studio. However, the full set of features is only
available when running from Maven. Thus all of the configuration is done through the `pom.xml` file.

===== Enabling Coverage

To enable MUnit Coverage, add the following configuration to the MUnit Plugin:

[source,xml,linenums]
.MUnit Coverage - Minimal Configuration
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.munit.tools</groupId>
  <artifactId>munit-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
  ...
  <configuration>
    <coverage>
      <runCoverage>true</runCoverage>   //<1>
    </coverage>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----
<1> This enables the coverage feature

When enabling MUnit Coverage, you only see a summary report in the console.
By default no other action is taken so it's merely informative.

This is how a summary report looks like:

[source,console,linenums]
----
[INFO] [CoverageManager] Printing Coverage Report...
[INFO] ===============================================================================
[INFO] MUnit Coverage Summary
[INFO] ===============================================================================
[INFO]  * Resources: 3 - Flows: 6 - Message Processors: 7
[INFO]  * Application Coverage: 71.43%
----

===== Failing Build

One of the features of MUnit Coverage is to fail the build if a certain coverage level is not reached.

To make the build fail, add the following lines to the configuration:

[source,xml,linenums]
.MUnit Coverage - Fail Build
----
<coverage>
  <runCoverage>true</runCoverage>
  <failBuild>true</failBuild>       //<1>
</coverage>
----
<1> Enable *Fail Build Feature*

Now, the next logical step is to define the coverage levels.

MUnit Coverage handles three different levels:

* Application
* Resource
* Flow

Here is how to define the required coverage level:

[source,xml,linenums]
.MUnit Coverage - Require Coverage
----
<coverage>
  <runCoverage>true</runCoverage>
  <failBuild>true</failBuild>

  <requiredApplicationCoverage>20</requiredApplicationCoverage>
  <requiredResourceCoverage>10</requiredResourceCoverage>
  <requiredFlowCoverage>5</requiredFlowCoverage>
</coverage>
----

TIP: Each value represents a percentage.

If you define coverage levels, but set the property `failBuild` to *false*, and if the levels are not reached, a warning displays in the MUnit Coverage summary.

Something like this:

[source,console,linenums]
----
INFO] [CoverageManager] Printing Coverage Report...
[INFO] ===============================================================================
[INFO] MUnit Coverage Summary
[INFO] ===============================================================================
[INFO]  * Resources: 3 - Flows: 6 - Message Processors: 7
[INFO]  * Application Coverage: 71.43%
[INFO]
[WARNING] ----------------------------- WARNING --------------------------------------
[WARNING]  * Application coverage is below defined limit. Required: 100.0% - Current: 71.43%  //<1>
----
<1> Warning detailing which coverage level wasn't meet

TIP: If no level is defined, -1 is assumed, which indicates that the build won't fail due to lack of coverage.

===== Reports

As we've shown before by default, MUnit Coverage shows summary report in the console. But that's not the only option.
MUnit Coverage currently offers two types of reports:

* Console
* HTML

The *Console* report, is printed in the console. It works with the summary report and
shows details of each resource, flow, sub-flow, and batch, and its coverage level.

The *HTML* report shows the same information, which you can view in any web browser.
To access the *HTML* report, browse your application folder structure:

* `${application.path}/target/munit-reports/coverage`

Locate the file *summary.html*, which is the starting point of the report and lets you navigate through all the data.

To enable the reports, add the following configuration:

[source,console,linenums]
.MUnit Coverage - Report Configuration
----
<coverage>
  <runCoverage>true</runCoverage>

  <formats>
    <format>console</format>  //<1>
    <format>html</format>     //<2>
  </formats>
</coverage>
----
<1> Console report
<2> HTML report

TIP: You can have none, one, or all the report types added to your configuration.

== Surefire Support

MUnit has Surefire support built in. No additional configuration is needed.

The reports can be found under `target/surefire-reports`.

== MUnit Maven Archetype

If you wish to create a Mule application project with MUnit support directly from Maven, you can use the Maven archetype.
