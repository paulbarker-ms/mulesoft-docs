= MUnit Utilities

MUnit provides a set of utilities for you to write your tests in a portable way and mock external system connections from your tests.

You can start a link:/munit/v/1.2/munit-database-server[Database] and an link:/munit/v/1.2/munit-ftp-server[FTP] server in your local environment and open a link:/munit/v/1.2/run-and-wait-scope[Run and Wait Scope] to configure your automated tests to start just after the threads opened by your production code have finished processing.
