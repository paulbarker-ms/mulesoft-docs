MUnit is a Mule application testing framework that allows you to easily build automated tests for your integrations and APIs. It provides a full suite of integration and unit test capabilities, and is fully integrated with Maven and Surefire for integration with your continuous deployment environment.

With MUnit you can:

* Create your test by writing Mule code
* Mock processors
* Spy any processor
* Verify processor calls
// COMBAK: This will be enable for RC
// * Create not only unit tests but also integration tests in a local environment -- MUnit allows you to start a local FTP/SFTP or DB server
* Enable or ignore particular tests
* Tag tests
// COMBAK: This will be available for RC
* Check visual coverage in Studio
* Generate coverage reports
// * Debug your tests with Studio


MUnit version 2.0, works with all Mule versions since 4.0

MUnit is divided in two main sub modules:

* MUnit
