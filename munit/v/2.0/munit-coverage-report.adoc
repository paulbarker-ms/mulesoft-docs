= About MUnit Coverage Reports

The MUnit Coverage feature provides a metric on how much of a Mule application has been executed by a set of MUnit tests. +
This lets you obtain a quality metric for your application.

MUnit Coverage is based on the amount of event processors executed. +
MUnit Coverage provides metrics for:

* Application overall coverage: An average of the items below.
* Resource coverage: Refers to each Mule configuration file under src/main/mule. Each of is considered a resource by MUnit Coverage.
* Flow coverage: Refers to any of the following components: Flows, Sub-flows, and Batch jobs.

[NOTE]
Coverage report runs only for EE edition runtimes

The following is a coverage report sample in JSON format. +
Use the code callouts below to understand each field in the report:

<1> Coverage percentage of the whole application.
<2> Required coverages for application, resources and flow, if the user did not configure any value it defaults to -1.
<3> Amount of flows in the application.
<4> Amount of event processors in the application.
<5> Amount of covered event processors.
<6> Amount of flows in that file.
<7> Coverage percentage of that file.
<8> Amount of event processors in that file.
<9> Contribution of that file to the coverage percentage of the whole application.
<10> Name of the flow.
<11> Type of the top level element. +
Other type of top level element in coverage is error-handler.
