= About Coverage in Maven

Since MUnit 2.x, the coverage report goal is properly integrated with the maven reporting section.

Coverage Reports are generated during Maven's site lifecycle. +
Since MUnit 2.x, coverage report generation is run separately during the "coverage-report" goal.

When enabling MUnit Coverage, you only see a summary report in the console. +
By default no other action is taken so it's merely informative.

This is how a summary report looks like:

[source,console,linenums]
----
[INFO] ===============================================================================
[INFO] 				MUnit Coverage Report
[INFO] ===============================================================================
[INFO]
[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But a console report is not your only option.
MUnit Coverage offers three types of reports:

* Console
* HTML
* JSON

The *Console* report is printed in the console. It works with the summary report and
shows details of each resource, flow, sub-flow, and batch, and its coverage level.

The *HTML* report shows the same information, which you can view in any web browser.
To access the *HTML* report, browse your application folder structure:

* `${application.path}/target/site/munit/coverage/`

Locate the file *summary.html*, which is the starting point of the report and lets you navigate through all the data.

The *JSON* report shows the same information as the _HTML_ report, in a JSON format. +
To access the JSON report file, browse your application folder structure:

----
${application.path}/target/site/munit/coverage/munit-coverage.json
----

To enable the report generation, add the following configuration:

[source,console,linenums]
.MUnit Coverage - Report Configuration
----
<coverage>
  <runCoverage>true</runCoverage>

  <formats>
    <format>console</format>  //<1>
    <format>html</format>     //<2>
    <format>json</format>     //<3>
  </formats>
</coverage>
----
<1> Console report
<2> HTML report
<3> JSON report

TIP: You can have none, one, or all the report types added to your configuration.

To configure, for example, the JSON report generation, you need to add the following configuration in your `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<coverage>
<runCoverage>true</runCoverage>
  <formats>
    <format>json</format>
  </formats>
</coverage>
----

One of the features of MUnit Coverage is to fail the build if a certain coverage level is not reached.

MUnit Coverage handles three different levels:

* Application
* Resource
* Flow

Here is how to define the required coverage level:

[source,xml,linenums]
.MUnit Coverage - Require Coverage
----
<coverage>
  <runCoverage>true</runCoverage>
  <failBuild>true</failBuild>

  <requiredApplicationCoverage>20</requiredApplicationCoverage>
  <requiredResourceCoverage>10</requiredResourceCoverage>
  <requiredFlowCoverage>5</requiredFlowCoverage>
</coverage>
----

TIP: Each value represents a percentage.

If you define coverage levels, but set the property `failBuild` to *false*, and if the levels are not reached, a warning shows up in the MUnit Coverage summary.

Something like this:

[source,console,linenums]
----
[INFO] ===============================================================================
[INFO] MUnit Coverage Summary
[INFO] ===============================================================================
[INFO]  * Resources: 1 - Flows: 1 - Processors: 2
[INFO]  * Application Coverage: 00.00%
[INFO]
[WARNING] ----------------------------- WARNING --------------------------------------
[WARNING]  * Application coverage is below defined limit. Required: 50.0% - Current: 00.00% //<1>
[INFO] ====================================================================================
----
<1> Warning detailing which coverage level wasn't met

TIP: If no level is defined, -1 is assumed, which indicates that the build won't fail due to low coverage.

Another feature is the ability to ignore either a flow or a file. This way, the ignored resource:

* Doesn't count as coverage data.
* Doesn't affect the overall number of message processors.
* Doesn't cause a build to fail if the flow is not tested or if the flow doesn't reach coverage metrics.
