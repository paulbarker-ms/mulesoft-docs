= HL7 Delete Segment Component Reference
:keywords: hl7, hapi, message object, delete, segment

Working with instances of HAPI message objects, this component deletes a segment from an HL7 message. If your HL7 message is not a HAPI message object, you must use the link:/healthcare-toolkit/v/1.3/hl7-encoding-transformer[HL7 Encoding Transformer] to convert it before it passes through the Delete Segment component.

[NOTE]
This component is part of the link:/healthcare-toolkit/v/1.3[Mule Healthcare Toolkit], which includes transformers, components and connectors for receiving, processing and sending HL7 messages. For details and a full list of available tools, consult the Toolkit's  link:/healthcare-toolkit/v/1.3[documentation main page].
