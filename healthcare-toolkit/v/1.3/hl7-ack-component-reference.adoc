= HL7 ACK Component Reference
:keywords: hl7, ack, component

The HL7 protocol specifies that when an application receives an HL7 message, it must return a message of type `ACK` (general acknowledge) to the sender. Before generating the ACK message, the receiving application must first check the original HL7 message that it received for formatting errors, missing data and other errors. Then, the receiving application generates the ACK message according to the results.

The *Mule HL7 ACK Component* processes the received HL7 message and automatically generates the appropriate ACK message.

[NOTE]
The HL7 ACK Component is part of the link:/healthcare-toolkit/v/1.3[Mule Healthcare Toolkit], which also includes transformers and components for receiving, processing and sending HL7 messages. For details and a full list of available tools, consult the Toolkit's link:/healthcare-toolkit/v/1.3[documentation main page].

|*ACK / NACK Code*
|The ACK or NACK (Negative ACK) code for the MSA-1 field of the ACK message. HL7 supports the following codes:

* `AA`: Application Accept
* `AE`: Application Error
* `AR`: Application Reject

ackCode="AA"

|*Strong / Weak Validation*
|Allows you to select between STRONG or WEAK HL7 message validation (leave blank for no validation).

* `STRONG`: Checks that all message structure components are present, and that the message is well-formed
* `WEAK`: Only checks that the message is well-formed

== Example Message Flow

To send an ACK message to the originating application, place the ACK Component before an HL7 Outbound Connector configured with the host name and listening port of the originating application. Consult the link:/healthcare-toolkit/v/1.3/testing-with-hapi-testpanel[example] page to see a simple flow that sends an ACK message using the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/all-flow-control-reference[All Flow Control] and the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/cache-scope[Cache Scope].
