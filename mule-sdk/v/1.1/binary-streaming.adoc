= Binary Streaming
:keywords: mule, sdk, streaming, binary

In binary streaming use cases, the stream is a flux of bytes that are treated in a generic way regardless of what they represent. Examples include the response of an HTTP request or retrieving and writing a file in a FTP server.

The SDK supports this abstraction by using the Java `InputStream` class.

== Binary Streaming in Operations

Operations can receive stream parameters, return streams, or do both.

The Write operation in the File connector is an example of an operation that operates over a stream:

[source, java, linenums]
----
public class FileOperations {

    public void write(@Content InputStream content, String path) {
        // do the writing
    }
}
----

If you have parameter of type `InputStream`, the SDK will provide all the necessary support for using Mule's streaming capabilities. The `content` parameter in the example above will always be assigned to a repeatable stream that points to the beginning of the stream, treating it as if this is the first time the stream is getting read, whether that is true or not.

Another possibility is that your operation _returns_ a binary stream instead, like the Read operation does:

[source, java, linenums]
----
public class FileOperations {

    public InputStream read(String path) {
        // do the reading
    }
}
----

If you return an `InputStream`, the SDK will automatically add all the necessary magic to make that stream repeatable.

== Configuring Streaming

By allowing elements such as `<repeatable-file-store-stream />`, `<repeatable-in-memory-stream />` and `<non-repeatable-stream />`, the SDK automatically adds support for configuring how streaming should behave. Here is an example that configures custom file store streaming for the Read example above:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<file:read path="myFile.json">
    <repeatable-file-store-stream inMemorySize="10" bufferUnit="KB"/>
</file:read>
----
