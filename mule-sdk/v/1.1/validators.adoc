= Validators with Mule SDK
:keywords: validation, validators, mule, sdk

Validators are operations validate the Mule Message without changing the message. Validators can produce these effects:

* If the condition the validator imposes is fulfilled, the flow continues, and the Mule Message remains unchanged.
* If the condition the validator imposes is not fulfilled, an error is thrown.

== What are the Requirements for a Validator?

To be a validator, an operation should meet these requirements:

* It should be reached by the `@Validator` annotation. This can be assigned at the class level or at the method level. When you use the `@Validator` annotation at a class level, all public methods are marked as validators.
* It should return `void`.
* It should throw at least one error that is (or extends from) `MULE:VALIDATION`. Upon a validation failure, validators must throw a Mule validation error or a child of one.

Methods with the `@Validator` annotation belong to the Stereotype `ValidatorStereotype`. Components cannot have two stereotypes, so you cannot assign more than one stereotype to a method.

Validators share the same UX as operations. Once your module is added for use in Studio, the validators will appear in the palette. When a validator is added to a flow, its parameters are assigned just as if it were an operation.

== How to Make a Validator

This example shows how to make a simple validator. It creates a simple extension named `balance`:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Operations({BalanceOperations.class})
@Extension(name = "balance")
@ErrorTypes(BalanceError.class)
public class BalanceExtension {

}
----

The `BalanceOperations` class below adds a validation method that is annotated with `@Validator`. The method throws an error type that comes from the generic validation error type. Note that you can also annotate the class `BalanceOperations` with `@Validator`, but if you do, any other operations in it will be flagged as validators.

[source,java,linenums]
----
public class BalanceOperations {
  @Validator
  @Throws(BalanceErrorsProvider.class)
  public void hasSufficientFunds(Integer balance, Integer price) throws Exception {
    if (price > balance){
      throw new ModuleException(BalanceError.INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS, new IllegalArgumentException("There is not enough money to make the transaction"));
    }
  }
}
----

This example creates the error to throw if the validation fails. Notice that it is named according to the validations failure.

[source,java,linenums]
----
public enum BalanceError implements ErrorTypeDefinition<BalanceError> {
  INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS(MuleErrors.VALIDATION);

  private ErrorTypeDefinition<? extends Enum<?>> parent;

  BalanceError(ErrorTypeDefinition<? extends Enum<?>> parent) {
    this.parent = parent;
  }

  @Override
  public Optional<ErrorTypeDefinition<? extends Enum<?>>> getParent() {
    return Optional.ofNullable(parent);
  }
}
----

The validator method needs an `ErrorTypeProvider` that knows all the error types
that the validation can throw. This example creates an `ErrorTypeProvider` that says that the only error the method can throw is of type *BALANCE:INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS*.

[source,java,linenums]
----
public class BalanceErrorsProvider implements ErrorTypeProvider {
  @Override
  public Set<ErrorTypeDefinition> getErrorTypes() {
    HashSet<ErrorTypeDefinition> errors = new HashSet<>();
    errors.add(BalanceError.INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS);
    return errors;
  }
}
----

== How To Use Validators

Assume that you want to use the validator created above on a flow. The syntax will be the same as if it were an operation. Because `balance` and `price` are required parameters, it is necessary to assign those. In this case, the validation is made with the values in the variables `price` and `balance`, but you could use any expression there:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<balance:has-sufficient-funds balance="#[vars.balance]" price="#[vars.price]"/>
----

== Validators and the "all" Scope

Because validators are of the Stereotype `ValidatorStereotype`, they can be used in the `all` scope from the Validation module.

The next example uses a validator from the Validation module. It also assumes that there is a number extension that has a validator named `isPositive` that validates whether a value is in fact positive.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<validation:all>
  <validation:is-not-blank-string value="#[vars.buyerName]"/>
  <number:is-positive value="#[vars.price]"/>
  <number:is-positive value="#[vars.balance]"/>
  <balance:has-sufficient-funds balance="#[vars.balance]" price="#[vars.price]"/>
</validation:all>
----

This example checks that there is a `buyerName` variable that is not an empty string. After that, it ensures that both variables, `price` and `balance`, have positive values. Finally, it checks whether there is a sufficient balance on the account with the validator.
