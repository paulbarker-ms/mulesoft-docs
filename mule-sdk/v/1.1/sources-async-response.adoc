= Sending Asynchronous Responses from a Message Source
:keywords: mule, sdk, sources, listener, triggers, response, output, asynchronous

Sources can send responses in an asynchronous way. Some of the main uses cases for asynchronous sources are:

* The response operation is non-blocking.
* The response operation is blocking, but it is asynchronously executed in a thread other than the one that initiates it (most typically, the thread executing a method annotated with `OnSuccess` or `OnError`).
* The source will perform asynchronous auditing for which it needs to consume a response stream in a separate thread.

In these cases:

* The runtime needs to know that the response will be asynchronous. Otherwise, there will be a race condition between the thread emitting the response and the runtime that is trying to free
up resources associated with the message that is getting a response.
* Methods annotated with `OnSuccess` or `OnError` must have an argument of type `SourceCompletionCallback`. That is enough to signal the runtime that the source is asynchronous.

The runtime will not finish the associated event until either the `success()` or `error(Throwable)` methods are invoked. Note that this is a very strong contract. A source that requests a `SourceCompletionCallback` without properly notifying the runtime is one likely to freeze the entire runtime eventually.

Here is an example:
[source, java, linenums]
----
@OnSuccess
public void onSuccess(@Content String response, SourceCompletionCallback callback) {
  asyncResponder.sendResponse(response, new ResponderCallback() {
    void onSuccess() {
      callback.success();
    }

    void onFailure(Throwable t) {
      callback.error(t);
    }
  };)
}
