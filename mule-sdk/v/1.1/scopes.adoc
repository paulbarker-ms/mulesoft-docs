= Creating Scopes with Mule SDK
:keywords: mule, sdk, scopes, scope, components

Scopes are similar to <<operations#, Operations>>, but their execution includes the execution of other child <<operations#, Operations>>. This means that a Scope is basically an operation that receives one or more arguments that are simple <<parameters#, Parameters>> along with a single `Chain` component and the `CompletionCallback`.

A `Chain` represents the child <<operations#, Operations>> that you declare inside the Scope and provide an abstraction to execute them.

== Declaring a Scope

You can see the basic structure of a Scope with this decorator example. It has the `Chain` to be executed and the `CompletionCallback` to invoke once the
scope execution is done _(yes, all Scopes are declared as <<non-blocking-operations#, Non-Blocking Operations>>)_:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Extension(name = "Docs")
@Operations(LogDecorator.class)
public class DocsModule {

}
----

[source,java,linenums]
----
public void logDecorator(Chain operations,
                         CompletionCallback<Object, Object> callback) {

  LOGGER.debug("Invoking child operations")
  operations.process(
    result -> {
      LOGGER.debug(result.getOutput());
      callback.success(result);
    },
    (error, previous) -> {
      LOGGER.error(error.getMessage());
      callback.error(error);
    });
}
----

Of course, if you receive a `Chain` of <<operations#, Operation>>, you need to execute
them in some way, and that is what the `process(successCallback, errorCallback)` does.
With it, the example executes the `Chain` in a non-blocking fashion and listens for the results in case of success or error. Here, the `successCallback` is called with the execution result when a successful execution is completed by _all_ the <<operations#, Operations>> in the `Chain`. The `errorCallback` will be called if an error occurs during the execution of _any_ child <<operations#, Operation>>, with both the error and the last successful result as arguments.

Here is how you use the scope in a Mule app:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="logDecoratorSampleFlow">
    <docs:log-decorator>
        <http:request config-ref="config" path="/" method="GET"/>
    </docs:log-decorator>
</flow>
----

This executes the `http:request` child operation wrapped by the `LOGGER` invocations.
Any number of <<operations#, Operations>> can be executed inside the scope, including other scopes or routers.


== Adding Parameters

Scopes can receive other simple `@Parameters` and `@ParameterGroups`. They are _simple_ because Scopes are not allowed to receive _complex_ parameters that
are declared as child elements. For example, if you want to customize the log level of the decorator, you will be able to receive that as a Parameter:

[source,java,linenums]
----
public void logDecorator(@Optional(defaultValue="true") boolean debug,
                         Chain operations,
                         CompletionCallback<Object, Object> callback) {

  if (debug){
    LOGGER.debug("Invoking child operations")
  }
  operations.process(
    result -> {
      Object message = result.getOutput();
      if (debug){
        LOGGER.debug(message);
      } else {
        LOGGER.info(message);
      }
      callback.success(result);
    },
    (error, previous) -> {
      LOGGER.error(error.getMessage());
      callback.error(error);
    });
}
----

With a minimal change in the Scope's API:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="logDecoratorSampleFlow">
    <docs:log-decorator debug="false">
        <http:request config-ref="config" path="/" method="GET"/>
    </docs:log-decorator>
</flow>
----

By default, a `Chain` is executed using the Message that was received by the container
Scope, but other definitions of the `process` method allow the user of the scope to customize the `payload` and `attributes` that will be used to execute the `Chain`.

== Using Stereotypes

`Stereotypes` can be used to limit the <<operations#, Operation>> that are allowed to exist inside a `Chain`, which enforces consistency in its usage. Only the <<operations#, Operations>> that have the given `Stereotypes` can be declared inside the Scope.

[source, java, linenums]
----
public void assertAll(@AllowedStereotypes(AssertionStereotype.class) Chain assertions,
                @Optional boolean failOnError,
                CompletionCallback<Boolean, Void> callback) {
  assertions.process(
    result -> {
      callback.success(Result.<Boolean, Void>builder().output(true).build());
    },
    (error, previous) -> {
      if (failOnError){
        callback.error(error);
      } else {
        callback.success(Result.<Boolean, Void>builder().output(false).build());
      }
    });
}
----

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="logDecoratorSampleFlow">
    <docs:assert-all>
      <docs:not-null value="#[payload]">
      <docs:not-empty-collection value="#[payload]">
    </docs:assert-all>
</flow>

== Config-less and Connection-less

Scopes have some restrictions that differentiate them from <<operations#, Operations>>. By definition, Scopes are not allowed to depend on or receive a particular <<configs#, Configuration>> or <<connections#, Connection>>.

== Only One Chain

The `Chain` component is key in the definition of a Scope, so it is _required_ to have one and _only_ one `Chain` argument.

== Always Non-Blocking

All Scopes must be defined as a `void` method receiving a `CompletionCallback` for communicating their Result, which means that all the Scopes are non-blocking by default.

See link:non-blocking-operations[Non-Blocking Operations].
