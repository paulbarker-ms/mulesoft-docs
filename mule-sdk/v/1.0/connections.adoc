= Modules Connectivity Framework
:keywords: mule, sdk, connection, connectivity, management, pooling, cached, provider, connection-provider

Connected modules (connectors) are probably the most common type of module.

The connectivity framework starts with the concept of a `ConnectionProvider`.
This is an interface responsible for creating, disconnecting, and describing the connection so that the runtime can handle it properly, while remaining abstracted from the concerns of managing those connections.

== Declaring a Connection Provider

To declare a new `ConnectionProvider` you should create a new class that implements the `ConnectionProvider` interface. The `ConnectionProvider` interface is a typed interface that receives one type argument that indicates the class of the instances that the `ConnectionProvider` handles.

This example declares a `FooConnectionProvider` class that implements the `ConnectionProvider` interface:

[source, java, linenums]
----
public class FooConnectionProvider implements ConnectionProvider<FooConnection> {

  @Parameter
  private String password;

  public FooConnection connect() throws ConnectionException {
    return new FooConnection(password);
  }

  public void disconnect(FooConnection connection) {
    connection.invalidate();
  }

  public ConnectionValidationResult validate(FooConnection connection) {
    return connection.isValid() ?
      ConnectionValidationResult.success() :
      ConnectionValidationResult.failure("Connection is not valid", new InvalidConnectionException());
  }
}
----

[NOTE]
Each defined `ConnectionProvider` must be instantiable, public, and have a default constructor.

Other components (such as an operation or source) that require access to the connection will gain access to the connection through instances of the `FooConnection` class.

The above example contains a `@Parameter` and these methods: `connect()`, `disconnect()`, and `validate()`. The next sections describe each of them.

=== Connection Provider Parameters

Like any other `Module` element, a `ConnectionProvider` can have `@Parameters`.
Each `ConnectionProvider` `@Parameters` must be a configurable element that is required to instantiate the actual connection, in the `connect()` method.

[WARNING]
Common `@Parameters` that are required by more than one operation must *not* be part of the `ConnectionProvider`. That's a common case for <<configs#, Configurations>> `@Parameter`. See <<parameters#, `@Parameter` section>>.

[[_connections_connect]]
=== Connect

The `connect()` method is in charge of instantiating the actual connections with all the configured parameters. It's *very important* to know that the returned connection is expected to be ready to use.

The returned *connection* does not need to implement an interface or contract. It doesnâ€™t necessarily reference the socket connection. It can simply be a client or something of that sort.

=== Disconnect

The `disconnect(Connection)` method receives a live connection and disposes it, freeing all it's allocated resources.

=== Validate

As mentioned <<_connections_connect, above>>, the `connect()` method in the `ConnectionProvider` *must* return a valid, fully functional connection. Because connections might become stale while sitting idle, the `ConnectionProvider` provides the `validate(Connection)` method. This method is invoked to check the connection before using it.

If the validation fails, the connection will be invalidated and a new one will be taken.

==== Connection Validation Result

The `validate(Connection)` method will return an object of type `ConnectionValidationResult`, which can result in two types: a `ConnectionValidationResult.success()` or a `ConnectionValidationResult.failure()`.

When a `failure()` is returned, a descriptive message and a failing `Exception` (which provides context about why the connection is invalid) should be provided to the new `failure()`. Optionally, an `ErrorType` can be provided to add the <<errors#, error handling>> capabilities.

* `failure(String, Exception)`
* `failure(String, ErrorType, Exception)`

== Adding a Connection Provider

Each `ConnectionProvider` is bound to a Configuration that can have none, one, or more than one `ConnectionProvider`.

To add a `ConnectionProvider` implementation to a Module Configuration, you need to use a `@ConnectionProviders` annotation. This annotation declares  each `ConnectionProvider` that a `Module` defines. It can be used at the `@Extension` or `@Configuration` level.

If an extension contains more than one `ConnectionProvider`, you need to use the `@Alias` to provide each with a significant name. By convention, the name of that connection provider adds the ``-connection` suffix to the provided name.

Example of a `ConnectionProvider` declared at `@Extension` level:

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Extension(name="foo")
@Operations(Operations.class)
@ConnectionProviders(FooConnectionProvider.class)
public class FooModule {

  @Parameter
  private String someParameter;

  public String getSomeParameter() {
    return someParameter;
  }
}
----

Example of the XML for this config with the example `FooConnectionProvider`:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<foo:config name="a-foo-config" someParameter="value">
    <foo:connection password="aVeryDificultPassword"/>
</foo:config>
----

== Connection Management

You can specify a few connection management strategies for a
`ConnectionProvider`.

=== Pooling Strategy

The connections are pooled. A cache of connections is maintained so that they can be reused when future requests require one.

This is useful when connections are expensive to create or when concurrent access to a connection instance is not supported.

// TODO link to MULE pooling profile configuration
For this pooling strategy, a pooling profile configuration is automatically added to the connection.

You can enable pooling connection management by implementing the `PoolingConnectionProvider` interface.

=== Cached Strategy

For each configuration instance, a connection is established and cached so that one specific configuration always gets the same connection. The connection is maintained until the configuration itself is stopped.

You can enable cached connection management by implementing the `CachedConnectionProvider` interface.

=== No Strategy

The runtime adds no additional infrastructure similar to the pooling cases.
The `ConnectionProvider` is responsible for providing the totality of the
connection-handling behavior. An operation that requires a connection calls the `connect()` method each time it needs a connection, and it destroys the connection once the operation is complete.

Implementing the `ConnectionProvider` interface means no strategy.

== Using Connections

Using connections in Operations and Sources is quite different, see:

* <<operations#_using_connections, Using Connections in Operations>>
* <<sources-config-connection#, Using Connections in Sources>>
