== Using Mule Services

When implementing your module, you might need to use some of the services that Mule provides. Examples of these services include `ObjectStoreManager`, `LockFactory`, and `HttpService`.

To achieve this, there is no need to get them from the registry of the `MuleContext`. You can simply inject them into your component (such as an operation, source, or configuration) through the `@Inject` annotation.

Here is a simplified example that injects a service from the registry into a component:

.Example: Using the @Inject Annotation
[source, java, linenums]
----
public class ObjectStoreOperations {
// ...
  @Inject
  private ObjectStoreManager runtimeObjectStoreManager;
// ...
  @Throws(StoreErrorTypeProvider.class)
  public void store(String key,
                  @Content TypedValue<Serializable> value,
                  @Optional @ParameterDsl(allowInlineDefinition = false) ObjectStore objectStore) {
    ObjectStore os = objectStore == null ? runtimeObjectStoreManager.getDefaultPartition() : objectStore;
    os.store(key, value);
  }
// ...
}
----

Here are some common Mule services:

* `LockFactory`: All Mule components that require synchronization to access shared data must be synchronized using locks from the default implementation of this interface.

* `ExpressionManager`: Provides universal access for evaluating expressions embedded in Mule configurations, such as XML, Java, scripting, and annotations.

* `TransformationService`: Service that tries to transform a value into another given type.

* `HttpService`: Provides both HTTP server and client implementations. Whenever using an HTTP connection on your connector, you should try to use this service.

* `SchedulerService`: Provides access to the different schedulers and thread pools that exist in the Mule runtime, allowing you to schedule tasks on those.

* `SoapService`: Service that creates SOAP clients to consume SOAP services.

* `ObjectStoreManager`: Manager in charge of creation and management of `ObjectStore` instances.
