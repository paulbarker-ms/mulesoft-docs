= Creating Configuration Objects
:keywords: mule, sdk, config, configuration

Configurations are a set of configurable parameters that affect the overall behavior of your module.
All modules are required to have at least one configuration, but you can define as many as needed.

Different configurations might not only provide a different set of parameters
but also specify their own set of operations, sources, and connection providers that
are only available when using that configuration.

== Defining Single Configuration Modules

The simplest of cases is that of a Module that has only one configuration.
For convenience, you can use the same class that you previously annotated
with `@Extension` for that, for example:

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Extension(name="singleConfig")
@Operations(Operations.class)
@Sources(MessageSources.class)
@ConnectionProviders({BasicAuthConnection.class, OAuthConnection.class})
public class SingleConfigModule {

  @Parameter
  private String someParameter;

  @Parameter
  private Integer numericParameter;

  public String getSomeParameter() {
    return someParameter;
  }

  public String getNumericParameter() {
    return numericParameter;
  }
}

----

The example above shows the full skeleton of a module with one single configuration.
You can see how the same class that declares the extension with all its operations,
sources, connections, and so on, is also enriched with `@Parameter` annotated fields,
which will translate into the configuration's parameters.

When another component, such as an operation or source, requires access to the
configuration, it will do so through instances of the `SingleConfigModule` class.

== Externalizing Single Configuration Object

Depending on how you want to organize your code, you might want to have a single
configuration object without reusing the `@Extension` annotated class. Reasons
for doing this might range from maintainability (you think that you might want to add
more configurations in the future), separation of concerns, or simply personal preference.

You can use the `@Configurations` annotation to do that. The same reworked example
looks like this:

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Extension(name="singleConfig")
@Configurations(Config.class) // <1>
public class SingleConfigModule {
}

@Configuration(name="config") // <2>
@Operations(Operations.class)
@Sources(MessageSources.class)
@ConnectionProviders({BasicAuthConnection.class, OAuthConnection.class})
public class Config {

  @Parameter
  private String someParameter;

  @Parameter
  private Integer numericParameter;

  public String getSomeParameter() {
    return someParameter;
  }

  public String getNumericParameter() {
    return numericParameter;
  }
}
----

<1> Reference a `Config` class using the `@Configurations` annotation.
<2> Define a class that acts as a configuration and defines the parameters, plus
all the other components such as operations, connections, and so on.

[TIP]
Notice that the `@Configuration` annotation requires you to give the configuration a
name. For modules with only one configuration, the name `config` is recommended.

== Defining Multiple Configurations

Let's explain this one using the HTTP connector as an example.

There are two sides to implementing the HTTP protocol: to listen for requests and
to send requests. Each of these aspects not only requires very different sets of
parameters, it also turns out that:

* To listen for request, you need to define an `<http:listener />` element that acts as a message source.
* To send a request, you need an `<http:request />` element that acts as an operation.

Because an application can contain many listener elements, the elements will only work when
paired with an `<http:listener-config />` taht contains general settings about how the
connection is to be established and other behavioral parameters. The same happens with the requester
operation, which is paired with an `<http:requester-config />` element.

The code looks like this:

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Extension(name="http")
@Configurations({HttpListenerConfig.class, HttpRequesterConfig.class}) // <1>
public class HttpConnector {

}

@Configuration(name="listener") // <2>
@ConnectionProviders(HttpListenerConnection.class)
@Sources(HttpListener.class)
public class HttpListenerConfig {

  /**
   * Base path to use for all requests that reference this config.
   */
  @Parameter
  @Optional
  @Expression(NOT_SUPPORTED)
  private String basePath;

  public String getBasePath() {
    return basePath;
  }
}

@Configuration(name="requester") // <3>
@Operations(HttpRequester.class)
@ConnectionProviders(HttpRequesterConnection.class)
public class HttpRequesterConfig {

  // the requester parameters
}
----

<1> The `@Extension` annotated class defines the two configurations.
<2> The `HttpListener` class defines the inbound connection and the message source that is exclusive to the listener feature.
<3> The `HttpConfig` class defines the request operation and the outbound connection type.

[TIP]
Notice that this time, the name used in the `Configuration` annotation doesn't follow
a specific default, but instead a descriptive name is used.

== Getting the Configuration Name

For logging or debugging reasons, you may want to know the name that this config instance
has on the application. For this, you can use the `@RefName` annotation. This annotation must
be used on fields of type `String`, and no two fields in the same class should bear this
annotation. Here is an example of how to use it.

In this example, you can see how to log the name of our component when it is getting initialized.
This way, you can have traceability of the different config instances.

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Configuration(name="config")
@Operations(Operations.class)
public class Config implements Initialisable {

  private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Config.class);

  @RefName // <1>
  private String configName;

  @Parameter
  private String someParameter;

  public String getSomeParameter() {
    return someParameter;
  }

  @Override
  public void initialise(){
    LOGGER.debug("Initializing config with name: " + configName);
  }

}
----

<1> The `@RefName` annotation signals that the name of the configuration used in the app
should be injected to the field `configName`.

You can see a concrete example of a DSL to see what would happen:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<my-extension:config name="exampleConfig" someParameter="aParameter">
----

In this case, the variable `configName` would take the value "exampleConfig". When
this config is initialized, you will see this reflected on the logs with the message:
`Initializing config with name: exampleConfig`
