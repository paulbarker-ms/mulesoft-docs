= Pushing Messages to a Flow form a Message Source
:keywords: mule, sdk, sources, listener, triggers, generate, push, message

After generating a piece of information for the flow, the source uses the `SourceCallback` to send the information to the flow. Returning to the minimalistic HTTP listener example:

[source, java, linenums]
----
public class HttpListener extends Source<InputStream, HttpRequestAttributes> {

    @Override
    public void onStart(SourceCallback<InputStream, HttpRequestAttributes> sourceCallback) throws MuleException {
        httpServer = serverProvider.connect(); // <1>

        server.listen(path).onRequest(request -> { // <2>
            Result<InputStream, HttpRequestAttributes> result = requestToResult(request); // <3>
            sourceCallback.handle(result); // <4>
        });
    }
}
----

<1> The example uses the ConnectionProvider to obtain an `HttpServer`. The typical connection provider most already configured the server with the proper host and port.
<2> HTTP requests are pushed into the server by the remote clients, and the `HttpServer` component will notify the source of every request. The source then uses the `SourceCallback` to push the message into the flow.
<3> The message is represented by leveraging the same `Result` object that operations use to communicate complex outputs. See <<result-object#, `Result`>> for more information.
<4> The example uses the `handle(Result)` method in the `SourceCallback` to pass the message.

== Threading Model

Once the `Result` object is passed to the `SourceCallback` through the `handle(Result)` method,   message processing occurs asynchronously in a different thread than the one invoking the method.

The next step explains how to catch the result of the Flow processing and optionally send a response.
