Note that if you want to configure MMC to persist data on external databases, you should follow the instructions for the specific database, as described in the following pages:

* MMC version 3.4.X prior to 3.4.2: link:/mule-management-console/v/3.6/persisting-mmc-data-on-external-databases[Persisting MMC Data On External Databases]
* MMC version 3.4.2 and above: link:/mule-management-console/v/3.6/persisting-mmc-data-on-external-databases[Persisting MMC Data On External Databases]

In the above pages, the paths of the directories where configuration files reside are based on an example Tomcat installation. When working with config files, you should change the directory paths to suit your Websphere installation. The table below lists examples of config file locations, using the MS SQL Server for illustration.

`sqlserver.jar` is the ConnectJDBC type 4 driver for Microsoft SQL Server provided by IBM. If you use `sqlserver.jar` as described above, you do not need to use the JDBC driver provided by Microsoft (`sqljdbc4.jar`). For details, see link:/mule-management-console/v/3.6/persisting-mmc-data-to-ms-sql-server[Persisting MMC Data to MS SQL Server] and the IBM documentation for link:http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS7JFU_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.express.doc/info/exp/ae/rdat_minreqmssql.html[data source minimum required settings for Microsoft SQL Server].
