= Persisting MMC 3.4.2 Data to MS SQL Server

*MMC Version 3.4.2 and Later*

This page describes how to set up and configure the Mule Management Console to persist environment and transaction data to http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/default[Microsoft SQL Server].

[WARNING]
This document lays out the instructions for deploying the Management Console on a production-ready environment using Apache Tomcat. All of the instructions should work with other link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/hardware-and-software-requirements[supported application servers] as well, but this has not been tested.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you have installed:

* **MMC Version 3.4.2**. Download it from the http://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[customer portal] if you need to upgrade to this version.
* *a* **Web application server such as Tcat, Tomcat, or JBoss**. Please refer to the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/hardware-and-software-requirements[Hardware and Software Requirements] for the latest information about hardware requirements and supported application servers, Java Runtime Environments, and browsers.

For practical purposes, this document mentions Tomcat as the servlet container; however, the instructions contained here apply also to Tcat or JBoss. If using Tcat or JBoss, make sure to unpack the Management Console .war file in the appropriate directory. For additional information, see link:/mule-management-console/v/3.4/installing-the-production-version-of-mmc[Installing the Production Version of MMC].

[WARNING]
*Known Issue with MS SQL and Java 6, Update 29* +
 +
There is a http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7105007[known issue] with Java 6, Update 29, regarding an SSL configuration which causes connection attempts to the database to hang indefinetely, with no timeout, thus preventing MMC startup. MS SQL cannot be used with this Java version. Please upgrade to a later JVM.

== Prerequisites

=== Database Connectivity

MS SQL Server must be configured to allow logging with a user name and password instead of only with integrated authentication (i.e. the security options need to specify SQL Server and Windows Authentication Mode).

The database must be accessible from the host where the Management Console resides. When in doubt, confirm that the connection is available using a standard client from the Management Console host.

[TIP]
====
Connection testing using the telnet command

If connection using a standard client fails due to a connectivity issue (not an authentication issue), confirm connectivity using the `telnet` command, if available on your system.

From the Management Console host, run:

[source, code, linenums]
----
telnet <database_host> <database_port>
----

If the connection succeeds, you should output similar to the following:

[source, code, linenums]
----
telnet 192.168.56.2 1433
Trying 192.168.56.2...
Connected to 192.168.56.2.
Escape character is '^]'.
----

The above output indicates that the connection was successful. A "connection refused" error usually indicates that nothing is listening on the specified host and port. Any other output, or lack of output, indicates a connectivity problem, such as a routing issue or firewall blocking requests between the Management Console host and the database host.

The telnet command only tests network connectivity, not authentication to the database.
====

== MMC Configuration

Configuring the Management Console to use MS SQL Server requires that you copy files to, and modify files contained in, the Management Console directory structure. This directory structure is contained in the .war file for deploying the Management Console to Tomcat.

It is recommended that you extract the contents of the console .war file to the `webapps` directory of your Tomcat installation and apply configuration to the extracted contents. The complete sequence of steps is:

. Ensure that the Tomcat servlet container is not running.
. Extract the Management Console .war file to the `webapps` directory under the Tomcat root directory. After extraction, the contents of the .war file should reside in `<TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps/mmc-3.4.2`. For example, if the Tomcat root directory is `/var/lib/tomcat6`, the Management Console's root directory should be `/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/mmc-3.4.2`.
. Perform the modifications described in this page: copying the `sqljdbc4.jar` file and modifying the appropriate configuration files.
. Ensure that there is no directory named `mmc-data` anywhere in the Tomcat directory tree.
. Start Tomcat, starting your customized Management Console for the first time.

The following sections explain how to configure the Management Console for MS SQL Server, working with the files extracted from the original Management Console .war file.

=== `sqljdbc4.jar` Driver Library

To use the Management Console with MS SQL Server, you need to add the `sqljdbc4.jar` library to the Management Console.

Download the library from the http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=11774[Microsoft Download Center]. You will have the option to download several files, including an executable file for Windows operating systems and a gzipped tar archive for Unix or Unix-based systems.

If using Windows:

* find and run the `qljdbc_<version>_enu.exe` file, then follow the installation wizard

If using a Unix or Unix-based system:

* uncompress and unpack the file `qljdbc_<version>_enu.tar.gz` file
* in the newly-created directory tree, locate the `sqljdbc4.jar` file

On both types of operating systems:

Copy the file `sqljdbc4.jar` to the following directory:` <MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF/lib`. For example, `/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/mmc-console-3.4.1/WEB-INF/lib`.

[TIP]
====
Unpacking gzipped tar files

To uncompress and unpack the .tar.gz file, open a terminal and use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing the file. Then, run the following commands:

[source, code, linenums]
----
gunzip <file>
----

This will uncompress the file, whose filename extension will change from `.tar.gz` to `.tar`. Unpack the file with the `tar` command, as shown below.

[source, code, linenums]
----
tar xvf <file>
----

For example:

[source, code, linenums]
----
cd Downloads
gunzip sqljdbc_4.0.2206.100_enu.tar.gz
tar xvf sqljdbc_4.0.2206.100_enu.tar
----

Some versions of the `tar` utility allow you to uncompress and unpack the file with a single command, as shown below.

[source, code, linenums]
----
tar zxvf <file>
----

For example:

[source, code, linenums]
----
cd Downloads
tar zxvf sqljdbc_4.0.2206.100_enu.tar.gz
----

This will uncompress and unpack the contents of the file in the current directory.

=== Configuration for Environment Data

Configuring MMC to store data on a MS-SQL Server databse involves two basic tasks:

* Modifying the file `web.xml` to tell MMC to use MS-SQL Server instead of its default database
* Modifying the file `mmc-mssql.properties` to set the parameters for connecting to the MS-SQL Server database

===== Modifying `web.xml`

. In the directory `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF`, locate the file `web.xml`, then open it for editing.
. Locate the `spring.profiles.active` section, shown below.
+

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<context-param>
<param-name>spring.profiles.active</param-name>
<param-value>tracking-h2,env-derby</param-value>
</context-param>
----

. Delete the string `env-derby`, then replace it with `env-mssql`, as shown below.
+

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<context-param>
<param-name>spring.profiles.active</param-name>
<param-value>tracking-h2,env-mssql</param-value>
</context-param>
----

. If you are also planning to <<Configuration for Transaction Data>> to MS-SQL Server, delete the string `tracking-h2` and replace it with `tracking-mssql`.

[TIP]
The `spring.profiles.active` section in the `web.xml` configuration file allows you to define what external databases are used for storing environment and/or tracking data. For a quick instructions for all supported database servers, see link:/mule-management-console/v/3.4/configuring-mmc-3.4.2-for-external-databases-quick-reference[Configuring MMC 3.4.2 for External Databases - Quick Reference].

===== Modifying `mmc-mssql.properties`

. In the directory `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/databases`, locate the file `mmc-mssql.properties`, then open it for editing.
. The table below lists the settings contained in the file. Modify the values as needed. In general, the only values that you should need to modify are `env.username`, `env.password`, `env.host`, `env.port` and `env.dbschema`.
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Default
|`env.driver` |Driver to use for connecting to the database |`com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver`
|`env.script` |Script to use for creating the tables in the target database |`sqlServer`
|`env.username` |Database user |`mmc_status`
|`env.password` |Password for the database user |`mmc123`
|`env.host` |Hostname or IP address where the database server is listening |`localhost`
|`env.port` |Port where the database server is listening |`1433`
|`env.url` |URL for connecting to the database |`jdbc\:sqlserver\://${env.host}\:${env.port};databaseName=${env.dbschema}`
|`env.dbschema` |Database to connect to |`mmc_persistency_status`
|===

. Save the file with your modifications, if any.

=== Removing Local Database Files

For the configuration changes to take effect, before launching MMC you need to delete the local database files that MMC uses by default.

In the root directory of your Web application server, locate the `mmc-data` directory (for example, `/var/lib/tomcat6/mmc-data`), then delete the `mmc-data` directory.

[NOTE]
Before you delete `mmc-data`, make a backup copy of this directory and store it in a safe location. If anything goes wrong with your new database configuration, you can use `mmc-data` to restore the old database configuration while you troubleshoot your new database config in a test environment.

At this point, MMC, is configured to store environment data on the external MS-SQL Server database that you specified.

=== Configuration for Transaction Data

Configuring MMC to store Business Events data on an MS-SQL Server database involves two basic tasks:

* Modifying the file `web.xml` to tell MMC to use MS-SQL Server instead of its default database
* Modifying the file `tracking-persistence-mssql.properties` to set the parameters for connecting to the MS-SQL Server database

===== Modifying `web.xml`

. In the directory `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF`, locate the file `web.xml`, then open it for editing.
. Locate the `spring.profiles.active` section, shown below.
+

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<context-param>
<param-name>spring.profiles.active</param-name>
<param-value>tracking-h2,env-derby</param-value>
</context-param>
----

. Delete the string `tracking-h2`, then replace it with `tracking-mssql`, as shown below.
+

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<context-param>
<param-name>spring.profiles.active</param-name>
<param-value>tracking-mssql,env-derby</param-value>
</context-param>
----

. If you are also planning to <<Configuration for Environment Data>> to MS-SQL Server, delete the string `env-derby` and replace it with `env-mssql`.

[TIP]
The `spring.profiles.active` section in the `web.xml` configuration file allows you to define what external databases are used for storing environment and/or tracking data.
