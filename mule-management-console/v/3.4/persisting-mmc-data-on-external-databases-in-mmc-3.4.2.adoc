= Persisting MMC Data On External Databases in MMC 3.4.2
:keywords: mmc, persisting

_*Enterprise Edition*_

_*MMC Version 3.4.2 and Later*_

By default, the Mule Management Console stores its persistent data on an embedded database on the local host. In this scenario, a catastrophic failure of the host would cause the loss of all data. You can avoid this situation by configuring MMC to store data on an external database, which ideally would reside on a dedicated server.

In MMC version 3.4.2, configuring MMC to store data on an external databases has been greatly simplified over previous versions. SeeÂ link:/mule-management-console/v/3.4/configuring-mmc-3.4.2-for-external-databases-quick-reference[Configuring MMC for External Databases] for an overview of the process, or the links provided below for details on supported database servers.

There are two kinds of data that MMC can store on external databases:

* *Environment data*, such as created alerts, deployments, dashboard portlets configuration
* *Transaction data* (Business Events)

You can configure MMC to store its data on the following database servers:

* link:/mule-management-console/v/3.4/persisting-mmc-data-to-postgresql[PostgreSQL]
* link:/mule-management-console/v/3.4/persisting-mmc-data-to-oracle[Oracle]
* link:/mule-management-console/v/3.4/persisting-mmc-data-to-mysql[MySQL]
* link:/mule-management-console/v/3.4/persisting-mmc-data-to-ms-sql-server[MS-SQL Server]
