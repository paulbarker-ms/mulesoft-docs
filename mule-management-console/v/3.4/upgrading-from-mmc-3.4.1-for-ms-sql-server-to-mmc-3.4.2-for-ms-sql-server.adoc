= Upgrading from MMC 3.4.1 for MS-SQL Server to MMC 3.4.2 for MS-SQL Server

*_MMC Version 3.4.2 and Later_*

== Overview

MMC version 3.4.1 for MS-SQL Server allows you to link:/mule-management-console/v/3.4/persisting-mmc-data-to-ms-sql-server[persist MMC data to MS SQL Server] instead of on MMC's default internal databases. Users of this version of MMC should upgrade to MMC 3.4.2 for MS-SQL Server.

Upgrading to MMC 3.4.2 patched for MS-SQL Server requires that you run a migration script on MS-SQL Server. Optionally, you can also run an additional script to drop indexes not used in MMC 3.4.2. This page describes the procedure for running both scripts.

[NOTE]
Before running MMC 3.4.2, you will also need to perform the steps described in link:/mule-management-console/v/3.4/upgrading-to-mmc-3.4.2-with-an-external-database[Upgrading to MMC 3.4.2 with an External Database]. Additionally, if your current MMC installation uses LDAP for user authentication, you must complete the steps described in link:/mule-management-console/v/3.4/upgrading-to-mmc-3.4.2-with-ldap[Upgrading to MMC 3.4.2 with LDAP].

== Downloading the MMC 3.4.2 .war File

From the Customer Portal, download the file `mmc-console-sqlserver-3.4.2.war`.

After downloading, expand the MMC 3.4.2 .war file, but do not run MMC 3.4.2.

== Downloading the Migration SQL Scripts

== Running the Scripts on MS-SQL Server

Before running the scripts, follow these steps:

* Ensure that no instance of MMC is connected to the MS-SQL Server – in other words, make sure that you have stopped your MMC 3.4.1, and that MMC 3.4.2 is not started, or not connected to the database on the MS-SQL Server
* In the MMC tracking (Business Events) database, back up the current value of the `SEQUENCE_TABLE` field (located in the only row of `OPENJPA_SEQUENCES_TABLE`)
* Both scripts use the database `MMC_PERSISTENCY`. If your database for MMC data has a different name, modify the name in the scripts by following these steps:
. Locate the statement `USE [MMC_PERSISTENCY]`.
. Replace `MMC_PERSISTENCY` with the name of your database.

After completing the above steps, run the migration script `sqlServerCustomersMigrate_341_to_342.sql` up to the following statement:

[source, code, linenums]
----
SELECT 0, SEQUENCE_VALUE FROM [dbo].[OPENJPA_SEQUENCES_TABLE] WHERE ID = 'EVENTS'
----

After running the above statement, verify that `SEQUENCE_VALUE` in `OPENJPA_SEQUENCE_TABLE` is the same as `SEQUENCE_VALUE` in `OPENJPA_SEQUENCES_TABLE`. After this, run the rest of the script.

[NOTE]
If you have run MMC 3.4.2 connected to MS-SQL Server before running the migration script, and `OPENJPA_SEQUENCE_TABLE` already exists, you can run the migration script if you skip the table creation statements and run from the `INSERT INTO` statement.
