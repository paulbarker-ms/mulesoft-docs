Welcome to the Mule Management Console documentation. Explore the links below and in the sidebar to the left of the page for in-depth user guides, tutorials, and reference materials.

This page provides an overview of Mule Management Console for new and prospective users. Jump to the <<Next Steps>> for links to information about installation, setup, and a walkthrough.

== Overview

*Mule Management Console (MMC)* centralizes management and monitoring functions for all your on-premise Mule ESB Enterprise deployments, whether they are running as standalone instances, as a cluster, or embedded in application servers. 

After software developer teams create Mule applications using link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/index[Anypoint Studio] or another IDE, they typically pass the Mule application to another team who deploys the application in a simulated environment for more rigorous testing. Afterwards, the application is run in production with strict requirements to be constantly available, performing at a certain rate, and continually working as expected. Moreover, additional Mule instances and applications may be introduced into the infrastructure, increasing the level of complexity inherent to managing and monitoring all systems.

*This is where MMC comes in.* MMC is an enterprise management and monitoring tool designed specifically for Mule ESB instances. MMC provides a comprehensive set of functionality for managing and monitoring running Mule instances, Mule clusters, applications within Mule instances, and the flows within those applications. It also provides ways of looking at specific transactions through pre-defined business events, as well as transactions in flight.

MMC provides a centralized, convenient, and intuitive web-based *interface* to monitor, manage, and administer the run-time aspects of Mule ESB. With MMC, you can save time and reduce errors by quickly identifying, diagnosing, and appropriately addressing problems across development, testing, UAT and production environments, all within a single interface.

== Benefits

MMC provides the following benefits:

* Simplified troubleshooting through quick access to the most relevant information
* Enhanced availability, scalability, and performance through clustering
* Improved visibility and understanding by analyzing real-time metrics that highlight significant changes
* Increased application uptime and performance through intelligent, proactive alerting and remediation tools
* Reduced downtime and time-to-resolution with deep diagnostics and auditing capabilities
* Minimal impact on the runtime performance of your ESB infrastructure
* Improved collaboration between operations and development through controlled access to runtime diagnostic information
* Lower management cost with group-based management and control
* Insight into key business-related events

== Requirements

To successfully run MMC in production, you need:

* A link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/downloading-and-starting-mule-esb[Mule ESB Enterprise] instance with a valid link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/installing-an-enterprise-license[enterprise license]
* The MMC console application file (mmc.war) deployed in a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/hardware-and-software-requirements[supported web application server]
* The MMC agent .jar file, which is bundled with the Mule ESB Enterprise instance in versions 3.7.0 and newer. Previous versions of Mule ESB require the agent to be installed separately.

Finally, here are a few important notes to keep in mind before deploying MMC:

* MMC is compatible only with Mule ESB Enterprise
* MMC is backward compatible with previous versions of Mule ESB
