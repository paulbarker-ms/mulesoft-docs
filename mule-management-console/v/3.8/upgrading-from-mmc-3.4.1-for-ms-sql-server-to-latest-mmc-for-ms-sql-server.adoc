= Upgrading from MMC 3.4.1 (Only) for MS-SQL Server to the Latest Version of MMC for MS-SQL Server
:keywords: mmc, debug, install, upgrade, update

== Overview

MMC version 3.4.1 for MS-SQL Server allows you to link:/mule-management-console/v/3.8/persisting-mmc-data-to-ms-sql-server[persist MMC data to MS SQL Server] instead of on MMC's default internal databases. Users of this version of MMC should upgrade to the latest version of MMC, which includes support for MS-SQL Server.

Upgrading to the latest version of MMC requires that you run a migration script on MS-SQL Server. Optionally, you can also run an additional script to drop indexes not used in MMC versions later than 3.4.1. This page describes the procedure for running both scripts.

[NOTE]
Before running the latest version of MMC, you will also need to perform the steps described in link:/mule-management-console/v/3.8/upgrading-to-mmc-with-an-external-database[Upgrading to MMC with an External Database]. Additionally, if your current MMC installation uses LDAP for user authentication, you must complete the steps described in link:/mule-management-console/v/3.8/upgrading-to-mmc-with-ldap[Upgrading to MMC with LDAP].

== Downloading the Migration SQL Scripts

There are two migration SQL scripts for MS-SQL Server:

* The migration script, `sqlServerCustomersMigrate_341_to_342.sql`, required for all installations
* The index drop script, `sqlServerCustomersOptionalIndexDrop_341_to_342.sql`, which is optional

Download these from the support portal or see the scripts for copy-paste.

[source, code, linenums]
----
USE [MMC_PERSISTENCY]
GO
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[OPENJPA_SEQUENCE_TABLE](
    [ID] [tinyint] NOT NULL,
    [SEQUENCE_VALUE] [bigint] NULL,
PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED
(
    [ID] ASC
)WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON) ON [PRIMARY]
) ON [PRIMARY]
GO
INSERT INTO [dbo].[OPENJPA_SEQUENCE_TABLE]
SELECT 0, SEQUENCE_VALUE FROM [dbo].[OPENJPA_SEQUENCES_TABLE] WHERE ID = 'EVENTS'
GO
/* VERIFY SEQUENCE_VALUE IN OPENJPA_SEQUENCE_TABLE IS THE SAME AS SEQUENCE_VALUE IN OPENJPA_SEQUENCES_VALUE */
/* THEN DROP OLD TABLE */
DROP TABLE [dbo].[OPENJPA_SEQUENCES_TABLE]

== Running the Scripts on MS-SQL Server

Before running the scripts, follow these steps:

* Ensure that no instance of MMC is connected to the MS-SQL Server – in other words, make sure that you have stopped your MMC 3.4.1, and that your new MMC is not started, or not connected to the database on the MS-SQL Server
* In the MMC tracking (Business Events) database, back up the current value of the `SEQUENCE_TABLE` field (located in the only row of `OPENJPA_SEQUENCES_TABLE`)
* Both scripts use the database `MMC_PERSISTENCY`. If your database for MMC data has a different name, modify the name in the scripts by following these steps: +
. Locate the statement `USE [MMC_PERSISTENCY]`.
. Replace `MMC_PERSISTENCY` with the name of your database.

After completing the above steps, run the migration script `sqlServerCustomersMigrate_341_to_342.sql` up to the following statement:

[source, code, linenums]
----
SELECT 0, SEQUENCE_VALUE FROM [dbo].[OPENJPA_SEQUENCES_TABLE] WHERE ID = 'EVENTS'
----

After running the above statement, verify that `SEQUENCE_VALUE` in `OPENJPA_SEQUENCE_TABLE` is the same as `SEQUENCE_VALUE` in `OPENJPA_SEQUENCES_TABLE`. After this, run the rest of the script.

[NOTE]
If you have run the new MMC connected to MS-SQL Server before running the migration script, and `OPENJPA_SEQUENCE_TABLE` already exists, you can run the migration script if you skip the table creation statements and run from the `INSERT INTO` statement.
