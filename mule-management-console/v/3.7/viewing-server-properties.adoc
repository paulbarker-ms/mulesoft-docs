= Viewing Server Properties

The Properties tab displays the JVM arguments (such as -Dmule.base), Mule context properties (such as the server ID), and system properties (such as JAVA_HOME). You can sort the table by the property name or value by clicking the column heading.

You see the server properties at the summary level. You can click a column heading to sort by that column and to group by property fields. You can also add or remove column headings from the display. Server property details include JVM arguments in this case.
