THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE UI, PER PABLO:
Text panels also support a templating language and provide auto-complete features. For example, when you start typing, you can see a list of matching template options from which you can select and edit, such as these:

----
{% codeblock %}
code_snippet
{% endcodeblock %}
{% img class URL width height title_text alt_text %}
----
