= Getting Started

Anypoint Monitoring is part of the Management Center in Anypoint Platform. It provides data on Mule apps that are running on <<runtime_versions>>, and you need to have the <<required_permission>> to use it.

Note that Functional Monitoring is covered in link:/api-functional-monitoring[API Functional Monitoring].

//TODO_HIGH: HOW TO USE ALERTS? * link:alerts[Alerts]

== Configurations

Custom dashboards and alerts require configuration before you can use them. For guidance, see:

* link:dashboard-custom-config[Configuring Custom Dashboards]
* link:alerts-config[Configuring Alerts]

[[required_permission]]
== Required Permission

To use Anypoint Monitoring, you need this Monitoring Center permission:

* Monitoring Center User

Typically, administrators set permissions through Access Management. See link:/access-management/users#granting-permissions-and-roles-to-users[Granting Permissions and Roles to Users].

[[runtime_versions]]
== Supported Platform and Mule Versions

For Anypoint Monitoring to start monitoring your Mule apps, you must deploy them to the appropriate version of Mule runtime.

|===
| Platform | Mule Version | Features

| Anypoint Platform (CloudHub)
| 3.8.7-AM
| Logs only

| Anypoint Platform (CloudHub)
| 3.9.0-AM
| Metrics and logs

| Anypoint Platform (CloudHub)
| 3.9.1-AM
| Metrics and logs

| Anypoint Platform (CloudHub)
| 4.1.1-AM
| JVM metrics only

| Anypoint Platform (CloudHub)
| 4.1.2-AM
| JVM metrics only
|===

Note that metrics are used by graphs and other charts within link:dashboards[Dashboards].

See <<update_app>>.

[[update_app]]
== Setting the Runtime Version

To set or change runtime version for your Mule app:

* For existing Mule apps:
+
. Go to Settings in Runtime Manager for that app.
. Choose the new runtime from the Runtime Version selector.
+
* For new app deployments:
+
Simply select the appropriate version in the deployment UI.
+
* For Anypoint CLI deployments:
+
If you are using the Anypoint CLI to deploy your Mule app (for example,
through a build pipeline), you need to include the `--runtime` parameter with
an appropriate value, for example:
+
[src,command,linenums]
----
anypoint-cli --username="..." --password="..."
 --organization="Mythical, Inc"
 --environment="Production" runtime-mgr cloudhub-application deploy
 --runtime="3.9.0-AM" helloworld ~/demoproj2.zip
----
+
* For Maven deployments:
+
If you are using Maven for deployment, you need to modify the `<muleVersion>`
tag in the `pom.xml` file to append the `-AM`, for example, changing `<muleVersion>3.9.0</muleVersion>` to `<muleVersion>3.9.0-AM</muleVersion>`).

//REMOVED PER PABLO GALIANO & SEBASTIAN:
//For Mule apps running on older versions of the runtime, Anypoint Monitoring will provide information from Runtime Manager, API Manager, and API Analytics.
