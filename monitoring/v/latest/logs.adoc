= Logs in Anypoint Monitoring

*link:https://www.mulesoft.com/anypoint-pricing[Titanium Subscription Required]*

In addition to logging through link:/runtime-manager/logs[Runtime Manager], you can use Anypoint Monitoring to aggregate your log files so that you can manage, search for, filter, and analyze your logs. These features support:

* Comparative analysis and identification of event and information patterns based on searches across selected Mule apps and environments.
* Searches within the logs of a specific worker (or set of workers) for a Mule app so that you can narrow scope of issues to check.
* Sharing a snapshot of important logs with developers who can work on the source of the issue.
