= To Validate Query Parameters and Headers



This procedure assumes that you have generated Mule flows using APIkit in Studio. You can configure APIkit Router to validate, or not, headers and query parameters. Strict query parameter and header validation limits parameters to those defined in the RAML. Enabling validations can affect performance. Many complex validations can cause a delay in response time, so if your use case cannot tolerate latency, you might want to disable validations. By default validations are disabled.

. In Studio, select APIkit Router.

. In Headers Strict Validations, select True to limit headers to those defined in the RAML.
