* API Console 4.0 that simulates calls to the API is not embedded in Studio.
+
You enter a URL, which appears when you run the API, to open API Console in a browser.
* Some APIkit XML elements and attributes, listed in the "APIkit XML Reference" changed. 
* Error handling aligns with Mule Runtime 4.0.
* APIkit 4.x removes the following APIkit 3.x properties:
** `consolePath`
** `consoleEnabled`


== APIkit Distribution

The timing of future improvements and fixes are no longer constrained by Studio or Mule Runtime release schedules. In Studio, you use the installation wizard to check for updates. To change an APIkit version, just change the dependency in the POM of your application with the latest version of the module.
