= To Add a Service to Get Only User Names



In this procedure, you add a flow to filter users to get a list of user names. You set up the Transform Message to return the results you want.

. Copy and paste the get:/users:api-config flow to create another flow: Select the flow, and then Edit > Copy. Click a blank area of the canvas, and select Edit > Paste.
+
A copy of the flow appears at the bottom of the canvas.
+
. In the copy of the flow, select the HTTP listener component, and in the properties editor, change the Path from /placeholder to */placeholder/names*.
. Drag a Transform Message component from the Mule palette to the right of the HTTP requester.
