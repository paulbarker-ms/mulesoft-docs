= Create a JSON Example Using a Text Editor

This procedure is part of the workflow that generates a Mule flow from the API specification.

After creating the api.raml file in a text editor instead of Design Center, you need to also create a dependent JSON example file. The API specification will include the example. 

Enter the following code into a text editor and save it as user-example.json in the same directory as the RAML file:
