= To Create a New APIkit Project

This procedure launches the new project and generates a Main flow with an HTTP Listener, an APIkit Router, and references to flows to handle errors. The project support REST resources and methods. These flows, aptly called skeleton flows, are the bare minumum needed to support the RAML specification. The RAML file imported by this procedure resides in `src/main/api`.
