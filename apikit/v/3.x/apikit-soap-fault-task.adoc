= To Generate a SOAP Fault
:imagesdir: ./_images

In this procedure, you use the SoapUI tool to identify an operation you need to implement by making the API that fails. You use the OrderTshirt operation to create a request in SOAP UI to place an order for a large t-shirt for John. The API cannot handle this operation and a SOAP fault occurs.

. Create a SoapUI project using the `+http://localhost:8081/TshirtService/TshirtServicePort?wsdl+` for the initial WSDL:
+
image:soapui-new-project.png[soapui-new-project.png]
+
. In the SoapUI client, request a large t-shirt for John by entering some values into the request envelope. For example:
+
* Enter *L* between the `<size>` tags.
+
* Enter *John* between the `<name>` tags.
+
. Submit the request.
+
The result is the SOAP fault.
