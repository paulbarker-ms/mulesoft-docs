In this procedure, you import the RAML into Anypoint Studio that you created in Design Center or in a text editor.

. In Studio, click File > New > Mule Project. In Project Settings, set the following options:
* Project Name: Type any name, for example, *myproject*.
* In API Implementation, check this Specify API Definition File Location or URL option.
* In Location, do one of the following:
+
** Select Design Center if you created api.raml in Design Center. Login to Anypoint Platform if necessary, and select api.raml.
+

+
** Alternatively, if you didn't create the RAML in Design Center, select Browse Files.
+

+
Browse to and select the `api.raml` that you created in a text editor.
+
. Accept the other default options, and click Finish.
+
The api.raml and the included user-example.json file are imported into the project.
+
When you finish, Studio launches the new project and generates a Main flow with an HTTP Listener, an APIkit Router, and error handling. Backend flows for consuming information from the `users` and `usersbyid` resources appear.
