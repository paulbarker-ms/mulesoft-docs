= To Create Flows and Exception Strategies

This procedure describes how to build a main flow, backend flows, and exception strategies to create an APIkit project. When you create a RAML in Studio, you have the option of generating backend flows, or not. Exception strategies are generated for a RAML-based API. You need to reference these strategies from the main flow. 

. Drag the following components for the main flow from the Mule palette:
+
* An HTTP (or Jetty) Listener
* An APIkit Router

+
. In the *Package Explorer*, right-click the project name.
. Select *Mule* > *Generate Flows from RAML*
+
The backend flows appear below the main flow.

. Expand the *Error handling* section in the main flow.
. Drag a *Reference Exception Strategy* component from the Mule palette to the Error handling section.
. On the Configuration.xml tab, add link:/apikit/v/3.x/apikit-basic-anatomy#raml-based-exception-strategy-mappings[exception strategy mappings] to the project right after the last `</flow>` tag.
