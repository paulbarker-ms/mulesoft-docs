= Deploying the Project

In Studio, you prepare the API for auto-discovery. You need to set multiple auto-discovery global elements, one for each flow to which you want to direct requests. In the auto-discovery global configuration, you select a drop-down containing the names of a flow in the project.

Finally, you run the project as a Mule application. Studio deploys the flows as individual APIs to Anypoint Platform, and registers the APIs with API Manager. After registering the APIs, you can apply policies.  

*To deploy an APIkit project to Anypoint Platform*:

. In Studio, select Anypoint Studio > Preferences > Anypoint Studio > Anypoint Platform for APIs, and enter your client ID and client secret.
. In the Global Elements dialog, configure auto-discovery by entering settings for a global element as follows:
+
* API Name: vending
+
* API Version: 1.0development
+
* Flow Name: api-main
+
. Enter auto-discovery settings for a second global element as follows:
+
* API Name: test-policy
+
* API Version: 1.0development
+
* Flow Name: apiFlow
+
. In Project Explorer, right-click the APIkit project name, and select Run As > Mule Application.
+
Studio connects to API Manager in API Platform. The Studio console indicates that the project is deployed:

. Sign into Anypoint Platform, or if you are already signed in, refresh the browser.
. Go to API Manager.
+
The vending and test-policy APIs appear in API Manager.

Using the implementation URI, you can now simulate calls to the API using API Console. For example:

`+http://192.168.127:8081/console+`

You can also apply policies to the APIs.
