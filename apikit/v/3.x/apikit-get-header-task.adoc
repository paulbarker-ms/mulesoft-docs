= To Get a SOAP Header

In this procedure, you retrieve a SOAP header from the request. In the SoapUI, the request window shows the soap Envelope header.

. In the SoapUI, modify the OrderTshirt request by entering a value for the API key. For example, enter `987654321` between the `<apiKey>` tags.

. In Studio, edit the DataWeave code to get the API key, which is an inbound property, from the header:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/xml
%namespace ns0 http://mulesoft.org/tshirt-service
---
{
  ns0#OrderTshirtResponse: {
    orderId: "I got a request from "
    ++ payload.ns0#OrderTshirt.name
    ++ ", using the following auth header "
    ++ inboundProperties['soap.AuthenticationHeader'].ns0#AuthenticationHeader.apiKey
  }
}

. Save and rerun the project.
