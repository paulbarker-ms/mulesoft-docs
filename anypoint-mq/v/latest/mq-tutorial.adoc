= Tutorial: To Use Anypoint MQ
:keywords: mq, tutorial, queue, exchange, message exchange, client, postman

This tutorial helps you send and receive messages using Anypoint MQ using a publish/subscribe
queue mechanism. Anypoint MQ provides a user interface built into 
link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] that
lets you send messages to a queue or message exchange, and then read the messages from a queue. 
Anypoint MQ also provides a connector that works with Anypoint Studio. 

== Prerequisites

. Read link:/anypoint-mq/mq-understanding[About Anypoint MQ].
. Create an Anypoint Platform account to configure an environment, user permissions, register applications in MQ, and to create queues and message exchanges. You can access Anypoint MQ in the Anypoint Platform and the left navigation bar. 
. An Enterprise license is required to use MQ. Contact the MuleSoft Sales team to get a free trial.
. Download and install Anypoint Studio.

Queue and message exchange names can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), dots (.), and dashes (-). All other characters are not allowed. Queue and message exchange names are limited to 127 characters in length.

== To Create a Queue

A queue provides a temporary area for holding messages. Applications
push messages to the queue, and other applications consume
the messages. In Anypoint MQ, you can read messages, return the messages
for later viewing, or delete a message. By default, messages return to the
waiting area so that other applications can read them. Messages persist until the
time to live (TTL) value expires--by default, a message persists in Anypoint MQ
for 7 days.

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click MQ.
. Click Destinations:
+
image:mq-destinations-option.png[mq-destinations-option]
+
. Click the blue plus icon image:mq-blue-plus-icon.png[mq-blue-plus-icon].
. In the drop-down, click *Queue*:
+
image:mq-create-q-screen-dlq.png[mq-create-q-screen-dlq]
+
. In the Create Queue screen, specify a name for the queue, and if needed, change the
Default TTL (time-to-live) and Default Lock TTL values. A message lock makes a message unavailable to other applications while locked. A locked message does not block other messages to be read.
. If you want your queue encrypted,
slide the encryption slider to the right.
. If your organization previously created a dead letter queue where undeliverable messages go, click *Assign a Dead Letter Queue* to enable this option. For more information on dead letter queues, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-queues#create-a-queue[To Create a Queue].
. When done, click *Save Changes*:
+
The queue creates and you are returned to the *Destinations* screen.

*Note*: Where you click on a queue entry in the Destinations screen governs
what you see next:

image:mq-entryui.png[mq-entryui]

*Note:* If you need to delete a queue, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-faq#how-do-i-delete-a-queue[How do I delete a queue?] in the link:/anypoint-mq/mq-faq[Anypoint MQ FAQ].

== To Send a Message to a Queue

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click MQ.
. Click Destinations.
. Click the MyDemoQueue entry in Destinations to view details about
the queue.
. Click the left side of the queue entry to open the Messaging feature, or click the right side of the queue entry and click the arrow to the right of the queue name:
+
image:mq-access-messaging2.png[mq-access-messaging2]
+
. In the settings page, click *Message Sender*:
+
image:mq-click-msg-sender2.png[mq-click-msg-sender2]
+
. Type text in the Payload such as `Hello Mules` (leave the *Type* field set to *Text*):
+
image:mq-msg-sender-text-payload2.png[mq-msg-sender-text-payload2]
+
. Click *Send*.

== To Verify the Message in a Queue

. Click Destinations.
. Click the right side of the queue entry to view details and see the number of messages in the queue:
+
image:mq-num-queued-msgs.png[mq-num-queued-msgs]

== To Get a Message From a Queue

. Follow the directions in <<To Send a Message to a Queue>> and
advance to Step 6, except click *Message Browser*:
+
image:mq-click-msg-browser2.png[mq-click-msg-browser2]
+
. Click Get Messages.
+
image:mq-get-messages2.png[mq-get-messages2]
+
. Click the message ID value to view the message.
+
image:mq-click-id2.png[mq-click-id2]
+
. If you want to return the message to the queue, so other applications can read
the message, click the Return Messages icon - this is the default condition. If you switch screens back
to the Message Sender or to Destinations, messages automatically return to the queue.
In Anypoint MQ, returning the messages to the queue is known as `nack` - the message is not altered. However,
the time to live (TTL) value you set when you created your queue determines how long the message is available
before Anypoint MQ deletes it.
+
image:mq-click-retmsgs2.png[mq-click-retmsgs2]
+
Alternatively, you can delete the message by clicking the trash can icon. Anypoint MQ provides three modes for how messages delete after they are viewed. For more information, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-ack-mode[Anypoint MQ Acknowledgement Mode].
+
image:mq-message-delete-trash-can-icon2.png[mq-message-delete-trash-can-icon2]

== To Test Your Application

Get a REST plugin for your browser so that you can send POST requests. Typical software:

* link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop[Postman for Chrome]
* link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-rest-client/fhjcajmcbmldlhcimfajhfbgofnpcjmb[Simple REST Client for Chrome].
* link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient[RESTClient for Firefox].
* link:http://www.telerik.com/fiddler[Fiddler for Windows].

The following is an example setup using Postman:

image:mq-post.png[mq-post]

To set up Postman for a REST POST:

. Specify the URL to send the message as `0.0.0.0:8081/mq/Hello`. You can also specify messages with spaces such as,
`0.0.0.0:8081/mq/My What A Great Message`.
. Click *POST* in the drop-down options menu.
. Click *Send* to post the message. You can send more than one message if you prefer.
. View the resulting reply from the Anypoint Studio web server.

== To View Your Message in Anypoint MQ

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click MQ.
. Click Destinations.
. Click `MyDemoQueue` at the right side to view the number of messages in the queue:
+
image:mq-messages-in-queue2.png[mq-messages-in-queue2]
+
You can see the number of messages in the queue. Having verified that you have messages, we can now view them.
+
. Click `MyDemoQueue` at the start of the entry to view the Queue Settings, Message Sender, and Message Browser.
+
image:mq-view-mydemoq-settings2.png[mq-view-mydemoq-settings2]
+
. Click *Message Browser* and click *Get Messages*:
+
image:mq-get-messages2.png[mq-get-messages2]
+
. Click a message ID and view the message to the right.
+
image:mq-click-id-to-see-msg2.png[mq-click-id-to-see-msg2]

You can repeat this process by returning to your REST POST application and sending and viewing more messages.
In the next section, we build on your knowledge, first with an administrative task of creating user roles and then creating and testing message exchanges, which let you send one message to multiple queues.

[[advancedmq]]
== To Create a Message Exchange

A message exchange groups one or more queues so that a message sent to the message exchange goes to all bound queues.

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click MQ.
. Click Destinations.
. Click the blue plus icon image:mq-blue-plus-icon.png[mq-blue-plus-icon].
. Click Exchange.
. Specify the name `MyDemoExchange`.
. Click the checkbox to bind MyDemoQueue to this message exchange.
. Click Save Changes.
. In the Destinations screen. click the message exchange Type to list its details.

To delete a message exchange, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-faq#how-do-i-delete-an-exchange[How do I delete a Message Exchange?] in the link:/anypoint-mq/mq-faq[Anypoint MQ FAQ].

== To Bind a Queue to a Message Exchange

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click MQ.
. Click Destinations.
. Click the left side of the message exchange entry in Destinations.
+
*Note*: Where you click on a message exchange entry in the Destinations table governs
what you see next:
+
image:mq-where-to-click-x2.png[mq-where-to-click-x2]
+
. In the Exchange menu, click Bind for each queue you want to bind to the message exchange:
+
image:mq-bind-queue-to-exchange2.png[mq-bind-queue-to-exchange2]

== To Send a Message to a Message Exchange

Sending a message to a message exchange is very similar to sending a message to a queue.
The only difference is that you can get the message from any queue bound to a message exchange.

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click MQ.
. Click Destinations.
. Click the `MessageExchange` entry in Destinations to view details about
the message exchange.
. Click the MessageExchange link in the details screen to access the Message Sender:
+
image:mq-exchange-msg-access2.png[mq-exchange-msg-access2]
+
. Click Message Sender:
+
image:mq-exchange-msg-sender2.png[mq-exchange-msg-sender2]
+
. Type the contents of the Payload and click Send:
+
image:mq-exchange-payload2.png[mq-exchange-payload2]

You can now use the Message Browser to get the message from the MyDemoQueue as described
in <<To Get a Message From a Queue>>.

You can also send comma-separated value (CSV) or JSON content in the payload by changing
the message Type value. For more information, see <<To Send a CSV or JSON Message>>.
