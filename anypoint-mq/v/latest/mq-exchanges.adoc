:keywords: mq, message, exchange, message exchange

A message exchange lets you send a message to one or more link:/anypoint-mq/mq-queues[queues] that are bound to the message exchange.

*Notes:* 

* FIFO does not support the use of a message exchange. Similarly, FIFO queues cannot be bound to a message exchange.
* Message exchange names can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), dots (.), and dashes (-). All other characters are not allowed. 
* Message exchange names are limited to 127 characters in length. 
* The maximum size of a message sent to a message exchange is 10 MB.

Before creating a message exchange, create one or more queues. For more information, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-queues#to-create-a-queue[To Create a Queue].

== To Send a Message to a Message Exchange

Sending a message to a message exchange is very similar to sending a message to a queue. The only difference is that you can get the message from any queue bound to a message exchange. The maximum message size sent to a message exchange is 10 MB.

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the `MessageExchange` entry in Destinations to view details about
the message exchange.
. Click the *MessageExchange* link in the details screen to access the Message Sender:

You can now use the Message Browser to get the message from the MyDemoQueue as described
in link:/anypoint-mq/mq-queues#to-get-a-message-from-a-queue[To Get a Message From a Queue].

You can also send comma-separated value (CSV) or JSON content in the payload by changing
the message *Type* value. For more information, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-queues#to-send-a-csv-or-json-message[To Send a CSV or JSON Message].
