<This is the template you should follow to create release notes for your product. Items that are in italics are placeholders that you should replace with actual information. Instructions to you will appear in angle brackets (<>). Keep in mind that release notes are standalone: our customers can search for particular topics, so there is no need to have hyperlinks to the documentation or URLs, which may change. Items that are optional will be called out in the template with <comments>. Release notes should be factual, informative, and direct.>
